<p>There are no doubt many, many important items missing from the list &mdash; climate change is a vast subject and this isn't supposed to be comprehensive. It's mainly a place for me to put things I find interesting so they can be referenced later, and hopefully others find it useful too.</p>

<!--excerpt-ends-->

<p>An item's inclusion or exclusion is not a reflection of my opinion on it's importance. The items are grouped loosely under headings, but otherwise the list is not in any particular order. The list will likely expand over time.</p>

<h1><strong><em>Explainers</em></strong></h1>

<h2>The Brutal Logic of Climate Change</h2>

<p>The true scale and urgency of climate change often gets lost in science-speak, but it is essential to understanding the need for immediate action. David Roberts is one of the writers bringing the reality to a general audience and making it plain and engaging to read.</p>

<h2>The New Abolitionism</h2>

<p>A piece by Chris Hayes of MSNBC on the financial blockers to climate change. Illustrates the scale of the issue by comparing it to the societal and financial implications of the US abolition of slavery the in the 19th Century.</p>

<p>"Averting planetary disaster will mean forcing fossil fuel companies to give up at least $10 trillion in wealth."</p>


<h2>The Uninhabitable Earth</h2>

<p>Flowery-language article warning of those effects of climate change which don't figure concretely in the general public imagination of what climate change means. Touches on ideas around food security, disease, direct heat exposure, air quality, war, and economic collapse, and more.</p>

<figure>

    <img alt="The Uninhabitable Earth" src="/images/blog/2018-09-17-climate-change-links-refs/uninhabitable.jpg">
  </a>
  <figcaption>The Uninhabitable Earth</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The article came under fire from some environmentalists for being too scary, which turns people away. Margaret Klein Salamon discusses the article, it's controversy, and comes to its defense <a href="http://theclimatepsychologist.com/climate-truth-and-the-new-york-magazines-the-uninhabitable-earth/">in her blog</a>.</p>

<h2>What can a technologist do about climate change?</h2>

<p>I'm a technologist, so this caught my eye. This is a personal view from the ex-Apple designer & developer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Victor">Bret Victor</a>.</p>

<p>Contains fantastic graphics and reasoned explanations, and has a great bit about the scale of the problem and possible solutions before going into the technologist part.</p>

<h2>Short Answers to Hard Questions About Climate Change</h2>

<p>A great entry point for the unaware newcomer, or for someone who feels confused by competing accounts of what's going on.</p>

<p>Like many above, this is framed in a way that illustrates the scale, but trades detail for brevity and quick accessibility. Covers a lot of ground very quickly, leaving it to you to dig further when you are done.</p>

<h2>Mainstream Media with Strong Climate Coverage</h2>

<p>A lot of news desks have cut their dedicated climate coverage as the industry contracts. Despite fluctuating levels of investment across the industry, some are doing a good job.</p>

  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/climate/introducing-our-newsletter-climate-fwd.html">
    <img alt="Climate Fwd" src="/images/blog/2018-09-17-climate-change-links-refs/fwd.jpg">
  </a>
  <figcaption>Climate Fwd</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here's some notable examples of good coverage in mainstream outlets: The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/climate/introducing-our-newsletter-climate-fwd.html">Climate Fwd</a> newsletters, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change">The Guardian's climate change section</a>. There's also the Pulitzer Prize-winning <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/">Inside Climate News</a>.</p>

<h1><strong><em>Approaches & Perspectives</em></strong></h1>

<h2>The Climate Psychologist</h2>

<p>Margaret Klein Salamon, a clinical psychologist fascinated by the discrepancy between climate reality and climate awareness and psychology, ultimately decided to use her skills to try to build a reality-based movement called <a href="https://www.theclimatemobilization.org/">The Climate Mobilization</a>.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="http://theclimatepsychologist.com/">

</figure>

<p>They advocate that we actually restructure the economy and society in a way that actually stands a chance of saving civilization. Read Margaret's <a href="http://theclimatepsychologist.com/">blog on climate psychology here</a>.</p>

<h2>DrawDown</h2>

<p>Described as "the most comprehensive plan ever proposed to reverse global warming," prepared by a global "coalition of leading researchers, scientists and policymakers." It's basically a list of ways to address global warming, ranked by order of positive impact, as calculated by an array of leading academics.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>Watch Paul Hawken describe it in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zaTGMl11hs">this presentation on YouTube</a>. It's a great video - Paul explains the origin of this project, who was involved in making assessments and why, and how they came to conclusions that surprised all of them.</p>

<h2>Fossil Fuel Divestment</h2>

<p>As Bill McKibben says "If it's wrong to wreck the climate, it's wrong to profit from that wreckage." I wrote about it <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/how-money-pushing-climate-needle">in 2015</a>.</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/23/a-beginners-guide-to-fossil-fuel-divestment">
    <img alt="A Beginner's Guide To Fossil Fuel Divestment" src="/images/blog/2018-09-17-climate-change-links-refs/divestment.jpg">
  </a>
  <figcaption>A Beginner's Guide To Fossil Fuel Divestment</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This global movement is about withdrawing stocks and bonds from companies involved in extracting fossil fuels. It's a social "delegitimization" tactic - the divestment itself won't significantly hurt the company's bottom line, but it aims to reshape the conversation and apply public pressure on politicians to act.</p>

<h1><strong><em>Communication</em></strong></h1>

<h2>The Secret to Talking about Climate Change</h2>

<p>Helpful little vignette. Actually contains some really solid general advice on how to be persuasive with others generally.</p>

<figure>
  <div class="video ratio-55">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RkklaXhbTuA"></iframe>
  </div>
</figure>

<p>Also good because it's only four minutes long, and uses stick figures. Hint: it's about listening.</p>

<h2>David Fenton</h2>

<p>The fossil fuel industry invests heavily in advertising & focus groups, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D8bVFxJsD0">really understands how to play</a> the public relations game. Associating brands with existing virtues and values, connecting on the human level, and so forth.</p>

  </div>
  <figcaption class="caption">David Fenton on the Challenge of Climate Communications</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>By contrast, the climate movement under-invests in PR. Perhaps a little stereotypically, Fenton suggests that the climate movement is so full of academics and nerds that they think all they have to do is publish the data and people will understand.</p>

<p>This argument may be presented in somewhat over-simplistic terms, but I actually believe there are crucial hard truths here.</p>

<h2>Connecting on Climate</h2>

<p>Research-backed, accessible, thorough guides on what works and what doesn't when forming climate-related communications. This is more about shaping content than developing strategies, and I think that these results are subject to change as new political realities emerge based on social, economic and cultural changes.</p>

<p>Progress is more or less unidirectional, according to this "myth", and all problems have solutions. They argue this is why we are so complacent in the face of imminent collapse.</p>

<h1><strong><em>Tools & Data</em></strong></h1>

<h2>Guardian: Live Carbon Countdown</h2>

<p>Live-time updated clock, showing how until we surpass our global 'carbon budget', locking in at least 2° of warmth. Estimates vary depending on calculation methodology.

<h2>The Doomsday Clock</h2>

<p>At the end of World War 2, atomic scientists were horrified that they had ushered in a new era in which humankind now had the <em>capability</em> to permanently wipe out civilization itself, something that had never existed before.</p>

  </div>
  <figcaption class="caption">A Vox Explainer: The Doomsday Clock</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To help avoid that actual outcome, they set up a society of experts with deep knowledge of global affairs who come up with a consensus of how close the world is to "midnight", or civilizational collapse.</p>

<p>From 1947-2007 the only thing deemed capable of causing civilizational collapse was nuclear war. From 2007 they entered a new category — unchecked climate change.</p>
