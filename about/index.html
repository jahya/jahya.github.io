				<p>Thoughtworks Arts, an incubator for artist-led emerging technology collaborations, activated more than 50 projects with over 400 contributors over seven years.</p>
				<p>These and other programs I've created and led work by building momentum within practitioner communities, working across functions, roles and domains, and enabling team members to find authentic expression through their contributions.</p>

				<p>With two decades experience as a hands-on artist and technologist, I produce my own projects and those of many others. My core mission is to propel projects and programs around shared identity in which we as practitioners see ourselves.</p>
				<p>I believe in the power of mapping our underlying personal motivations to the activities we engage in to supercharge teams and produce effective and surprising outcomes.</p>

The visualization is a stylized flat graphic with dynamic splotches of red and black color travelling vertically through a stone-like artery. The screens both also show the same number '87' as an overlay to the visualization." />
