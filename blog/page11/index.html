One is anchored, deep, singular; the other plural, free, ephemeral. The works will run together and combine to express different emotional responses to the space.</p><p><strong>Gravity</strong><br>The first piece is <a href=//blog/intuition-and-direction-of-project>the piece inspired by the Seagram Murals</a>. It is an audio-visual piece for the ground floor.</p><p>The visual aspect consists of video projected onto a triptych of custom-made panels. The video is based on experiments with light - particularly, sketches I created using a scanner and a few basic materials (see images, right). The audio aspect works alongside the video, and is based on field-recorded and synthesized sounds, combined in simple measure, abstract in nature.</p><p>As I discussed in <a href=//blog/intuition-and-direction-of-project>this previous post</a>, the piece is an attempt to make a space for reflection - a place where time stands still for a moment. For this reason I'm working with variations on basic patterns - blends, torn lines, scrapes, which expose themselves very slowly over time. I am trying to create power from the simplicity of these forms - constantly I am thinking of weight, strength, and power. I am not trying to emulate the Seagram's, rather to work with some of these elements that they expose.</p><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style="float: right; margin-bottom: 0.5em; padding-bottom: 6px; padding-left: 6px; padding-right: 6px; padding-top: 6px; text-align: right"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px"><a href=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iRxUUGvfa7o/Tb_O7UZxlJI/AAAAAAAAAGg/XxByurAza08/s1600/Sketch1_b.png style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><img alt="Sketch (b) for Gravity" height=320 src=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iRxUUGvfa7o/Tb_O7UZxlJI/AAAAAAAAAGg/XxByurAza08/s320/Sketch1_b.png style="cursor: move" width=171></a></div></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="font-size: 13px; padding-top: 4px; text-align: center"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px">Sketch (b) for <i>Gravity</i></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Reflections</strong><br>The second piece is a 3D-sound piece, and will be heard on the various speakers dotted across the Jaaga space. This piece has become a counterpoint to the Gravity piece, and is best described by it's evolution.</p><p>First, I developed the method. I looked into different 3D sound design approaches and <a href=//blog/cosm-collision-detection-and-volume>eventually came up with a custom approach</a>, and built it in <a href=http://www.allosphere.ucsb.edu/cosm/gallery.html>Cosm</a>. On a side note, I've been in touch with the author of this software, Graham Wakefield. He is including examples of the method in the next release of Cosm, and writing about it in a paper for this year's <a href="http://www.computermusic.org/page/23/">ICMC</a>.</p><p>I had considered using this method as an integrated part of the Gravity installation. But as the Gravity piece developed, it went strongly in a particular direction. It was singular, weighty, personal - I knew it needed a counterpoint. The speakers in the rest of the building could be used in a way that is free, unconstrained by one location or time.</p><p>At the same time, I had a powerful sense that Jaaga is such a communal space, I wanted some way of giving expression to the feelings of the community. I wanted space for them to share their feelings on what Jaaga is, was and has become. From here, the second piece became about Reflections.</p><p>This is a perfect moment for reflection, and today I approached video artist <a href="http://www.clemencebarret.com/">Clemence Barret</a>, who is running a video workshop in the space. We agreed to work collaboratively to capture dialog from the people who have been at Jaaga the longest. The conversations we capture will in any case be a nice piece for the archive, and for future works. But the sound of this dialog will feed directly into the Reflections piece.</p><p>As with Gravity, I want Reflections to focus somehow on the primary, the abstract, the emotional nuances. The captured conversations will exist as records in their own right, but the memories of so many people can exist as fragments in this soundwork - roaming freely, injecting emotion and values into the space, and filling the gaps between the steel uprights of Jaaga.</p><p>The work continues on both pieces.</p></div><a class=read-more href=/blog/two-works-for-jaaga-gravity-and-memory>Read more &gt;</a><hr class=separator></article><article role=article itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/BlogPosting><header><h1><a href=/blog/cosm-collision-detection-and-volume>Cosm, Collision Detection and Volume</a></h1><div class=widgets>Posted on <time itemprop=dateCreated datetime=2011-04-27>Wednesday 27 April, 2011</time><ul class=social><li><a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=Cosm,%20Collision%20Detection%20and%20Volume&amp;url=http://jahya.net/blog/cosm-collision-detection-and-volume&amp;via=hardwarehacklab"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Cosm,%20Collision%20Detection%20and%20Volume&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/cosm-collision-detection-and-volume"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&amp;t=Cosm,%20Collision%20Detection%20and%20Volume&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/cosm-collision-detection-and-volume"><i class="fa fa-tumblr-square"></i></a></li></ul></div></header><div class=post-content><p>I searched today for a new 3D sound solution for Max/MSP, in a deliberate attempt to get away from Ambisonics and other 'sweet-spot'-inspired spatialisation techniques. Funnily enough, what I found led me back to a familiar name from Ambisonics - Graham Wakefield.</p><p><strong>About Cosm</strong><br>As it turns out, Graham is quite prolific. After building <a href=http://www.grahamwakefield.net/soft/ambi~/index.htm>the core Ambisonics externs</a> he went on to create Cosm - a virtual world environment. It's comprehensive, it works in Max/MSP/Jitter, and Graham is very open to let people use it. For me as a novice at Jitter it was a breeze to pick up thanks to a <a href=http://www.allosphere.ucsb.edu/cosm/index.html>great website</a> and an <a href=http://www.allosphere.ucsb.edu/cosm/chemotaxis.html>excellent tutorial</a>.</p><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nGKhCwzc480/TbhkpKvLbdI/AAAAAAAAAGY/oH7M3YpJHAk/s1600/gl_9_1_2010_1912409.gif style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><img alt="A screencap of the Cosm environment, mixing solid objects with a diffusion pattern" height=213 src=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nGKhCwzc480/TbhkpKvLbdI/AAAAAAAAAGY/oH7M3YpJHAk/s320/gl_9_1_2010_1912409.gif width=320></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">A screencap of the Cosm environment, mixing solid objects with a diffusion pattern</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Cosm's particular emphasis is in the relationship between solid objects and diffuse elements. Solid objects are modeled with traditional vector graphic techniques, and diffusion is&nbsp;modeled&nbsp;by underlying 3D value matrices. Perfect for Jitter.</p><p>When it came to building in sound, the natural choice for Graham was to use his&nbsp;Ambisonics externs. After all, this is how people have come to expect to explore virtual worlds - from a first-person, virtual camera, 'sweet spot' perspective.</p><p><strong>Using Collision Detection</strong><br>As I discussed in <a href=//blog/going-further-with-ambisonics>a previous post</a>, first-person perspective is not what this is all about. But that's no problem - I can bypass the <span style="font-style: italic">cosm.audio~</span>&nbsp;object altogether and use collision detection values to ramp up and down the volume levels on individual loudspeakers.</p><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0zt7kCoMFZI/TbheX7T08AI/AAAAAAAAAGQ/vn5eLpGuMa8/s1600/img.png style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><img alt="A representation of a sound object (red) passing through a loudspeaker catchment area (green)" height=140 src=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0zt7kCoMFZI/TbheX7T08AI/AAAAAAAAAGQ/vn5eLpGuMa8/s200/img.png width=200></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">A representation of a sound object (red) passing through a loudspeaker catchment area (green)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the image above, the red octahedron represents a moving sound object.

The name seemed to have a nice ring, because it sounded like it might be&nbsp;the kind of vector/panning solution I described at the end of the&nbsp;<a href=//blog/going-further-with-ambisonics>Going Further</a>&nbsp;article.</p><a href=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KvrhIoscfvw/TdELqZk-xqI/AAAAAAAAAHc/lpX7zGlRuF8/s1600/86400_7029.jpg style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em"><img alt="Stock photo of a speaker" height=206 src=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KvrhIoscfvw/TdELqZk-xqI/AAAAAAAAAHc/lpX7zGlRuF8/s320/86400_7029.jpg width=320></a><p>VBAP was developed by Ville Pulkki, a postdoctoral researcher at the Helsinki University of Technology.&nbsp;I looked up his&nbsp;<a href=http://lib.tkk.fi/Diss/2001/isbn9512255324/article4.pdf>article on implementing VBAP with MaxMSP</a>, and downloaded the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.acoustics.hut.fi/research/cat/vbap/">free software</a>&nbsp;that goes with it.&nbsp;Ville begins his article by explaining the reason for creating VBAP, and it seems that this approach can&nbsp;accommodate&nbsp;a wider variety of loudspeaker layouts.</p><p><strong>How it Works</strong><br>In short, it takes so-called 'pair-wise' panning - i.e. the panning of localised sounds between two loudspeakers - and does a little more math to extend it into triplet-wise panning.&nbsp;The three loudspeakers are arranged in a triangle layout.&nbsp;Localised sounds no longer just pan horizontally, between two positions, but now pan vertically too. This change means that we have extended from 1-dimensional movement into 2-dimensional movement.</p><p>As Ville's diagram shows, as you add more triangles you can extend into the 3rd dimension too, by creating a 'mesh' similar to the polygons that describe 3D space in computer games. The amplitude of any sound 'moving through' the space is calculated for each of the nearest three speakers. The equation takes into account&nbsp;<i>distance</i>&nbsp;from the loudspeaker, and so VBAP differentiates from Ambisonics and irregular loudspeaker layouts can be supported. However there still needs to be a 'mesh' based on triangles, as any individual sound can only exist between the nearest three points.</p><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style="margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-bottom: 6px; padding-left: 6px; padding-right: 6px; padding-top: 6px; text-align: center"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px"><a href=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_0Vkx4VNm-o/TbA2X5QZoiI/AAAAAAAAAGI/JvT3QA9RfXs/s1600/vbapbig.gif style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><img alt="Ville's VBAP diagram" height=177 src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_0Vkx4VNm-o/TbA2X5QZoiI/AAAAAAAAAGI/JvT3QA9RfXs/s320/vbapbig.gif style="cursor: move" width=320></a></div></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="font-size: 13px; padding-top: 4px; text-align: center"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px">Ville's VBAP diagram</div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The emphasis here is still on satisfying a 'sweet spot', a localised and immobile audience. In this respect, VBAP is similar to Ambisonics. As i'll discuss later on, at Jaaga we are going to experiment with layouts that don't require 'sound localisation' of the type catered for by these approaches. I'll go into that in another post.</p><p><strong>A Side Note: Finding Max Externals</strong><br>It's worth noting at this stage where I found Ville's pluggable VBAP externals, and a number of variations.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.maxobjects.com/">MaxObjects.com</a>&nbsp;is a known central repository where developers share their externals, and as such it is to MaxMSP as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/">CodePlex</a>&nbsp;is to .NET.</p><p>It's just useful to keep these sites on hand. The importance of bookmarking them will become clear next time you try to use Google to find libraries or externals!

This idea resonated very soundly with me as my last two projects have been case studies which effectively prove his point.</p><p><a href=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rPDC_M5gAXc/TdER6XYtc7I/AAAAAAAAAIA/i6EgnXqnk0U/s1600/IMG_4206.JPG style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em"><img alt="Working on projects at Jaaga" height=320 src=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rPDC_M5gAXc/TdER6XYtc7I/AAAAAAAAAIA/i6EgnXqnk0U/s320/IMG_4206.JPG width=213></a>Those experiences taught me a lot about creative process, which I'll come back to on another post. But on this current project, it's enough to say that I have purposefully avoided creating any kind of blueprint upfront. I have put anxieties over timing and achievement to one side and allowed the process to emerge naturally, even to the extent of what medium and which space to use.</p><p>On the one hand I have paid attention to what everyone else has been doing and saying, as there are several other artists preparing work for the&nbsp;<span style=font-style:italic>final show</span>. I have spent time in the space, and immersed myself in what is happening there - this is not hard to do at Jaaga. I have also explored potential media options - educating myself and experimenting with electronics, motors, and ambisonics.</p><p>Somehow along the way a general vision started emerge, and when I explored it, I found something I think could be right for the downstairs space.</p><p><strong>Jaaga Is Immovable</strong><br><a href=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BHjQR6U29i0/TdESAW99h3I/AAAAAAAAAIE/34JnmuKbfBM/s1600/IMG_4220.JPG style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em"><img alt="Moving panels at Jaaga" height=213 src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BHjQR6U29i0/TdESAW99h3I/AAAAAAAAAIE/34JnmuKbfBM/s320/IMG_4220.JPG width=320></a>In a nutshell, there are a lot of separate projects moving at once, involving movement, sensors, and interaction. many of the discussions have involved some grandiose concepts. It's a bit dizzying, being surrounded by a constant and powerful swirl of different creative ideas. Some of them are quite complex in terms of interaction and presentation. Many of them don't <i>seem</i>&nbsp;to relate to each other. And as discussed in a recent post, <a href=//blog/reflections-what-is-jaaga>the change in the project context and an externally-imposed deadline</a>&nbsp;have had their effects too.&nbsp;I found myself wanting to head for the centre - to the 'eye' of the whirlpool.</p><p>Suddenly I wanted to create something technically simple, visually and audibly simple, but <span style=font-style:italic>by virtue of simplicity,</span> something impactful. I wanted the pace slow, the essence emotional, the mood reflective. But in particular, in relation to the impending move of Jaaga, and all the uncertainty that surrounds - I wanted to create something explorably deep. Like dropping anchor, a huge weight to the ground, to say only one thing: "Right now, at this moment, WE ARE HERE, and it means something."</p><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Uvq_26YOdZc/TdERJjdHKuI/AAAAAAAAAH8/JxVfx8stBkk/s1600/IMG_4229.JPG style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><img alt="Film students co-working at Jaaga" height=213 src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Uvq_26YOdZc/TdERJjdHKuI/AAAAAAAAAH8/JxVfx8stBkk/s320/IMG_4229.JPG width=320></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Film students co-working at Jaaga</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Jaaga is the kind of place where all kinds of ideas fly and many things are possible, but I feel only sad when I think that she is moving. I agree that she is by nature a movable environment, but I feel it's a little before her time. I think there was more potential for her to connect with her community, and to develop her character before being asked to change. And I wanted to create some little bit of space for reflection on that.</p><p>Despite my emphasis on simplicity, it's not an easy challenge. Master artists spend lifetimes searching for simplicity and depth, and almost immediately my thoughts turn to Rothko and the Seagram Murals.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rothko - Not a Mystic</strong><br>This statement was Rothko's response to people who asked him if he was a Zen Buddhist:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I am not interested in any civilization except this one. The whole problem in art is how to establish human values in this specific civilization.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Rothko was very much in the here and now. Here he fiercely defends his ultimate intention, which is only to forge a connection between his audience and himself, via the physical body of his work.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I'm not an abstractionist. I'm not interested in the relationship of color or form or anything else. I'm interested only in expressing basic human emotions: tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on.&quot;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&quot;The people who weep before my pictures are having the same religious experience I had when I painted them&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Rothko was not religious. What he means by these statements is that he is solely interested in exploring human <span style=font-style:italic>condition</span>, psychological and emotional as it is. The important word here is <span style=font-style:italic>solely</span>. The Seagram murals contain <span style=font-style:italic>nothing but</span>&nbsp;these emotions, and each aspect of their construction - size, shape, colour, texture and composition - serves solely as a partial communicator of that condition.</p><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/huizevondel/5696416543/" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" title="Rothko Seagram Murals Tate Modern London by Grote Leider, on Flickr"><img alt="Rothko Seagram Murals Tate Modern London" height=250 src=http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2790/5696416543_97dd68686e.jpg width=375></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Rothko's Seagram murals on display at Tate Modern, London</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In Rothko's earlier work, mythical and mystical symbols were sometimes depicted figuratively. This inclusion seems to have been based on the Jungian idea that the human psyche is "by nature religious". From this understanding, the evolution of the various religions of world history were driven in part by the need to fulfill certain purposes that the human psyche required. If Western culture were to continue on a non-religious path, it made sense to find secular ways to fulfill the needs of the psyche no longer attended to by religion. One of these needs was a sense of mystery, which Rothko and others thought could be&nbsp;satisfied by myth and folklore.</p><p>After the war, like many artists of the time, Rothko couldn't bring himself to paint figuratively any more because of the inadequacy of the figurative form to express the state of the world as he saw it. Or, in his own words: "It was with the utmost reluctance that I found the figure could not serve my purposes. But a time came when none of us could use the figure without mutilating it."</p><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/huizevondel/5696992148/" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" title="Rothko Seagram Murals Tate Modern London by Grote Leider, on Flickr"><img alt="Rothko Seagram Murals Tate Modern London" height=500 src=http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5190/5696992148_e03b212388.jpg width=333></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Rothko's Seagram murals on display at Tate Modern, London</td></tr></tbody></table><p>It was this, along with tragic experiences in Rothko's personal life that lead the steady process toward an increasingly tragic oeuvre. But what interests me across the breadth of his career is more the attention to the human psyche, to the slow, subtle and ponderous attention to specific aspects of the psyche. And ofcourse, the notion, exemplified by the "people who weep" quote, of how intuition works in an artistic context. The idea goes that as an artist, your goal should not be to teach or preach, as though you have something to tell the world that it can't get somewhere else anyway. It's not about transcendental quasi-religious experiences as such (at least not for an unbeliever like me). It's about <span style="font-style: italic">experiencing something yourself</span>, and finding some way to put that something out there so that others who are minded to can share in that experience.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't want to delve too deeply into the nuances of Rothko's art. Rather I want to acknowledge him as a source of inspiration at the moment and return to intuition. I have begun a series of sketches on my computer which I intend to project when I get back to Bangalore on Wednesday. I want to see how the colours translate into projected light, and begin exploring a very fundamental question for me at the moment:</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">Just how deep can projected light go?</span></p></div><a class=read-more href=/blog/intuition-and-direction-of-project>Read more &gt;</a><hr class=separator></article><article role=article itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/BlogPosting><header><h1><a href=/blog/reflections-what-is-jaaga>Reflections: What is Jaaga?</a></h1><div class=widgets>Posted on <time itemprop=dateCreated datetime=2011-04-16>Saturday 16 April, 2011</time><ul class=social><li><a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=Reflections:%20What%20is%20Jaaga?&amp;url=http://jahya.net/blog/reflections-what-is-jaaga&amp;via=hardwarehacklab"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Reflections:%20What%20is%20Jaaga?&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/reflections-what-is-jaaga"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&amp;t=Reflections:%20What%20is%20Jaaga?&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/reflections-what-is-jaaga"><i class="fa fa-tumblr-square"></i></a></li></ul></div></header><div class=post-content><p>When I arrived at Jaaga four weeks ago to begin my residency, the first thing I found out was that Jaaga - the building - was to move in June. The owner of the land, Naresh, an architect and ultimately a businessman, had decided to develop what is a prime central Bangalore location.&nbsp;There was not (and still is not) a definite destination for the structure. This single fact has been of sweeping importance to the direction of the Jaaga experiment as a whole, and to that of the now-termed <span style="font-style: italic">final show</span>&nbsp;in Richmond Town.</p><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style="float: right; margin-left: 1.2em; margin-top: 1.1em; text-align: center"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B-39338XI5g/TdEAkNdaCVI/AAAAAAAAAHE/S1bvyoIe-Ss/s1600/4817162087_2b57efcfe1_z.jpg style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><img alt="Jaaga under construction in 2009" height=320 src=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B-39338XI5g/TdEAkNdaCVI/AAAAAAAAAHE/S1bvyoIe-Ss/s320/4817162087_2b57efcfe1_z.jpg width=240></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Jaaga under construction in 2009</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Light and Sound</strong><br>The perspective was starkly different late last year. I agreed to come and work on the <span style="font-style: italic">Light and Sound</span> project understanding that the goal was to make a permanent change to the nature of the space.&nbsp;There was a knowledge that the land was borrowed, but Jaaga grew cultural roots, and there was a false sense of security.</p><p>Jaaga's self-definition sprouted organically in this period - nothing seemed mutually contradictive. It could be an art space, either in the academic or the Burning Man sense. It could be a business startup and co-working environment. It could be a place for poets, photographers, musicians, programmers, hackers - it could host community events, informal groups or big business conferences showcasing&nbsp;their&nbsp;'cool urban' credentials.&nbsp;Jaaga was, in other words, whatever you wanted it to be when you walked in through the gate.<br>Now, Jaaga&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic">could</span>&nbsp;end up back in a central location, where all of these things would remain a realistic and vibrant possibility. But this is very difficult - everyone knows that any space in the city center is a tough find in one of India's fastest-growing cities. So the conversation about where Jaaga moves <span style="font-style: italic">to</span> necessarily implies a conversation about what Jaaga <span style="font-style: italic">is</span>, since any move from it's current location will mean a change in audience.</p><p><strong>The 'Final Show' - A Statement</strong><br>When the fact of the move sank in, it took a week or two to absorb the consequences. At first, there was a naïve sense that the all the move presented was a test to the idea of Jaaga's reconfigurability - that the installation work produced should be easy to disassemble and reassemble in the new location.</p><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style="float: right; margin-left: 1.2em; text-align: center"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FRqgXTrQvEg/TdEApSz3HRI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/BVNLLmgceL8/s1600/5645429747_78c3d7d6e9_z.jpg style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><img alt="A roof garden party at Jaaga" height=213 src=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FRqgXTrQvEg/TdEApSz3HRI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/BVNLLmgceL8/s320/5645429747_78c3d7d6e9_z.jpg width=320></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">A roof garden party at Jaaga</td></tr></tbody></table><p>But in truth there wasn't time for this. Jaaga is a place that grows step by step and slice by slice. The nature of the building means that it's hard for the first version of something to be the last version of something. Jaaga is an experiment in constant flux. Whether it's providing electricity for an event or waterproofing the ceiling, there is always a stream of innovative new solutions being implemented. It would take time for permanent installations to mature before they could be assured survival in a changed environment. And ofcourse, there is no guarantee of what shape, size or <span style="font-style: italic">kind</span> of space the future Jaaga would occupy, and therefore what role permanent installations might play.</p><p>So as the term <span style="font-style: italic">final show</span> emerged, the <span style="font-style: italic">Light and Sound</span> project lost it's sense of permanence. The project had now become something very different. It had become an opportunity to make a statement. This statement would not be something organically bound to the building's frame (à la Eve Sibley's vertical garden), but rather would be something which would come, go, and live on only in memory.</p><p><strong>Philosophical Openness</strong><br>But what kind of statement should be made? Every day spent in the building is an opportunity to see in action the flux of life at Jaaga. And of the various people preparing work for the final show, each is somehow indicative of a strand of thought in a very multistranded space. The co-founders and Directors, Freeman Murray and Archana Prasad, have created and developed a view of themselves which seems designed to incorporate all of these various views under one overarching theory. They call it The Enlightened Singularity.</p><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style="float: right; margin-left: 1.2em; text-align: right"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-z3oxlRrqdhs/TdEAqxcG-QI/AAAAAAAAAHU/JLyN0Pbu9S4/s1600/5646040516_3ae85f6f98_z.jpg style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><img alt="A photography exhibition at Jaaga" height=240 src=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-z3oxlRrqdhs/TdEAqxcG-QI/AAAAAAAAAHU/JLyN0Pbu9S4/s320/5646040516_3ae85f6f98_z.jpg style="cursor: move" width=320></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">A photography exhibition at Jaaga</td></tr></tbody></table><ol style="text-align: left"><li><a href=http://www.jaaga.in/immaculate-vitro>The Enlightened Singularity - Immaculate Vitro</a></li><li><a href=http://www.jaaga.in/enlightened-singularity>The Enlightened Singularity</a></li><li><a href=http://www.jaaga.in/living-building>The Living Building</a></li></ol><p>And there is ofcourse also the concept of the Living Building.

Jaaga is a very accepting place, and so it prefers philosophies which allow it to continually add - people, ideas, materials, concepts - into the whole, from any directions which seem to benefit. However, what is now becoming clear is that openness in all directions is one of the luxuries of remaining in a state of constant flux.

But that is one of the things that make it a very interesting project to be a part of.</p></div><a class=read-more href=/blog/reflections-what-is-jaaga>Read more &gt;</a><hr class=separator></article><article role=article itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/BlogPosting><header><h1><a href=/blog/going-further-with-ambisonics>Going Further with Ambisonics</a></h1><div class=widgets>Posted on <time itemprop=dateCreated datetime=2011-04-11>Monday 11 April, 2011</time><ul class=social><li><a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=Going%20Further%20with%20Ambisonics&amp;url=http://jahya.net/blog/going-further-with-ambisonics&amp;via=hardwarehacklab"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Going%20Further%20with%20Ambisonics&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/going-further-with-ambisonics"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&amp;t=Going%20Further%20with%20Ambisonics&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/going-further-with-ambisonics"><i class="fa fa-tumblr-square"></i></a></li></ul></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Continuing on from my&nbsp;<a href=//blog/introduction-to-ambisonics>introduction to ambisonics</a>, I now want to find out more about ambisonics by exploring an implementation in Max/MSP. Max doesn't natively have objects for ambisonics, so I googled for externals. There are a few results, but one of the better-looking ones (and as it happens, the first result) is published by a British academic named Graham Wakefield.</p><div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em"><a href=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-v1hw6O6AE5Y/TdELeG8UxbI/AAAAAAAAAHY/0V6evbTaW2E/s1600/1128376_43162062.jpg style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img alt="Stock photo of a mixing desk" height=185 src=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-v1hw6O6AE5Y/TdELeG8UxbI/AAAAAAAAAHY/0V6evbTaW2E/s320/1128376_43162062.jpg width=320></a></div><p>You can check out <a href=http://www.grahamwakefield.net/soft/ambi~/index.htm>Graham Wakefield's ambisonics for Max/MSP here</a>. What's attractive about this result is it has exactly the three things I would want to see:</p><ol style="text-align: left"><li>A brief introduction to the available objects (named in a way that makes sense based on Bruce Wiggins' tutorial videos)</li><li>A concise screenshot showing the major objects in action - generating sounds, encoding to B-Format, performing a transform (rotate) operation, and decoding for a four-channel listening space.</li><li>Download links for Windows and Mac!</li></ol><p>So i'll give this external package a try.</p><p><strong>Soundfield Transformations</strong><br>One thing that jumps out looking at the demo images on this page, is that although there is a <span style="font-style: italic">rotate</span> object, the other standard transforms are not there (<span style="font-style: italic">scale</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">translate</span>). Until now I've found that any time you encounter one transform operation you usually encounter the other two. I'm not sure the reason for this at the moment, but I've thought about it and marked it down as a curiosity.</p><p><strong>Azimuth and Elevation</strong><br>The next thing to notice is that Graham's encoder, just like Brian Wiggins, mixes Azimuth and Elevation variables with a mono sound source. So it's time to get a better sense of how these variables work together to create the 3D effect.</p><p>A little googling tells me that these variables in this context refer to the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_coordinate_system>horizontal coordinate system</a>. This is the system used for space-object observation, and satellite dish positioning. The system seems to be so named because the azimuth and elevation variables only make sense with reference to a horizontal plane (the plane labelled 'horizon' in the image). Notably, it also only makes sense with respect to a specific observer (standing at the 'origin' - the intersection of the zenith and the horizon).</p><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9QLOozHXOVM/TZ2ppa4I3hI/AAAAAAAAAFk/KCeQie1DvSw/s1600/714px-Azimuth_%2528PSF%2529.svg.png style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><img style=background:white alt="The horizontal coordinate system" height=256 src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9QLOozHXOVM/TZ2ppa4I3hI/AAAAAAAAAFk/KCeQie1DvSw/s320/714px-Azimuth_%2528PSF%2529.svg.png width=320></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">The horizontal coordinate system</td></tr></tbody></table><p>So in our ambisonic listening space, imagine you as an observer go to the origin and look due North (0 degrees). Then you turn 45 degrees East. This is the value of your Azimuth (position A in the image). You then tilt your head 45 degrees upwards. This is the value for your Elevation (position B).</p><p>So these two variables can describe any direction in a soundfield from an origin. What this can't seem to describe is <span style="font-style: italic">how far away</span> the object is. You could be looking straight at it but there's no variable to tell you whether it's on the moon or right in front of your nose.</p><p><strong>Loudspeaker Orientation - but not Position</strong><br>The <span style="font-style: italic">ambi.decode~</span>&nbsp;help patch shows the horizontal coordinate system in action. Each output channel from the decoder is by convention assigned a loudspeaker position related to a platonic solid. For example with 8 channels you could choose a 2D horizontal 'ring' layout (octagonal), a 3D 'cube' layout, or a 3D&nbsp;'superimposed tetrahedron' layout. The loudspeakers are then positioned in the listening space where the intersections occur between lines in the shape.</p><div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em"><a href=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O6HgLZAQW2A/TaKl3cOcw6I/AAAAAAAAAFo/9lIZQ-ypvmU/s1600/ambi1.png style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img alt="A Max/MSP sample" height=139 src=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-O6HgLZAQW2A/TaKl3cOcw6I/AAAAAAAAAFo/9lIZQ-ypvmU/s320/ambi1.png width=320></a></div><p>Depending on the chosen layout you can then feed decoder orientation values for each loudspeaker, as horizontal coordinate system pairs. The <span style="font-style: italic">ambi.decode~</span> help patch has some examples:</p><div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em"><a href=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lyuGt9Nbe2g/TaKmWJiNjKI/AAAAAAAAAFw/Atzm2K4E7zo/s1600/ambi2.png style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img alt="A Max/MSP Sample" src=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lyuGt9Nbe2g/TaKmWJiNjKI/AAAAAAAAAFw/Atzm2K4E7zo/s1600/ambi2.png></a></div><p>If you sketch out the example values (as I have), you can see how they work, along with predefined positioning, to construct a listening environment:</p><div class=separator style="margin-bottom: 1em; clear: both; text-align: center"><a href=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-r98u-T_ORik/TaK9jFj8hrI/AAAAAAAAAF0/g5c9bG3TLIw/s1600/sketch.png style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img alt="Sample values sketched along ezimuth and elevation" height=170 src=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-r98u-T_ORik/TaK9jFj8hrI/AAAAAAAAAF0/g5c9bG3TLIw/s200/sketch.png width=200></a><a href=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cIAHEij6Vkg/TaK9mj4fqgI/AAAAAAAAAF4/2NAjDf80vo4/s1600/sketch2.png style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img alt="A sketch showing a listener at the center of a cube layout" height=163 src=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cIAHEij6Vkg/TaK9mj4fqgI/AAAAAAAAAF4/2NAjDf80vo4/s200/sketch2.png width=200></a></div><p>Looking at the cube layout sketch, you start to really get a sense of what an ambisonic soundfield really is. It's a 2 or 3-dimensional version of stereo (stereo being 1-dimensional). This also starts to explain why only the <span style="font-style: italic">rotate</span> transformation is included in Graham's patch. The other transformations make less sense in this context, and much more sense in the cartesian coordinate systems I'm used to.</p><p><strong>The Sweet Spot</strong><br>Ambisonics is therefore designed with a 'sweet spot' in mind. This spot will emanate from the origin, and it's size will be dependent on the loudspeaker setup and the nature of the listening environment (outside noise etc).</p><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cakelab/4308012705/" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" title="Jelly Donut (Sufganyiot) by CakeLab NYC, on Flickr"><img alt="Jelly Donut with sweet spot in the middle" height=185 src=http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4042/4308012705_19c461a265.jpg width=250></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Sweet-spot inspired food</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Looking for more information, I came across an introduction written by Florian Hollerweger, a Sound Art PhD student at Queen's University Belfast.</p><ul style="text-align: left"><li><a href=http://flo.mur.at/writings/HOA-intro.pdf>Florian's Intruduction to Higher-Order Ambisonics</a></li></ul><p>The text describes how there are two different approaches to decoding B-Format data (Projection vs. Pseudoinverse). However, both methods share a crucial feature in common - it's very important that the layout of the soundfield be as regular as possible - and as closely related as possible to a platonic solid shape which the decoder is instructed to decode for.</p><p><strong>Higher-Order Ambisonics</strong><br>Florian goes on to describe the nature of higher-order ambisonics. It quickly becomes clear that each higher order of ambisonics is basically about increasing the number of decoded channels - i.e. using a platonic solid with more intersections (to place the loudspeakers on).</p><p>This does a number of things:</p><ol style="text-align: left"><li>First, it increases the 'resolution' of loudspeakers, and therefore the 'localisation' of sounds. What 'localisation' means is your ability to point confidently to where you think a sound is coming from, without necessarily pointing straight to a loudspeaker. In other words, it's the illusion that the sounds around you are really floating freely rather than emanating from loudspeakers. This only applies for a listener in the sweet spot - degradation will still occur in a similar way as you move away from the sweet spot regardless of which order of ambisonics you use.</li><li>However, secondly it will increase the <span style="font-style: italic">size</span> of the sweet spot. More speakers equals more volume, and the added loudspeakers mean that you can move them all further away to attain the same volume for a listener at the origin. The listener would have to walk further away from the origin before they experience the degradation - but the degradation would occur in a similar way.</li><li>Ofcourse, it means adding a number more encoder channels - 5 more for second-order and 7 for third-order.</li></ol><p><strong>What Ambisonics Can't Do</strong><br>All of the emphasis in ambisonics is on the sweet spot. It's still that thing of imagining a single listener in the middle (like my stick man in the image above), or a collection of listeners in a single space hearing the same thing. Even with all the extra layers and complexity, it's still about creating one sound (or soundspace).</p><p><a href=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uHXh5koXhKk/TaLhUMUoFuI/AAAAAAAAAGE/4098PPnCO34/s1600/bird.png style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em"><img alt="Sketch of a bird flying through a cube" height=160 src=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uHXh5koXhKk/TaLhUMUoFuI/AAAAAAAAAGE/4098PPnCO34/s200/bird.png width=200></a>It's patently <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> about creating a number of different sound experiences at once, with a freely moving audience, all experiencing their own personal version of the sound. And, (as a specialised version of that), it can't produce an 'environmental' type of 3D sound.</p><p>What do I mean by that? Imagine a real physical bird flying through a 'cube' listening space, creating a fairly continuous noise as it flaps it's wings and crows. Imagine also that you are standing right next the point of the bird's entry, underneath a loudspeaker, looking toward the centre of the listening space.&nbsp;As the bird flies over your head you should hear the sound very loudly. The sound would then diminish for you even before the bird reached the centre of the space.</p><p>For a listener at the centre, the sound would start quietly and get louder when the bird reached the centre. This effect is not possible with ambisonics - you could cater for the listener at the centre (the sweet spot) but not for the listener at the edge. The soundfield is focused inwards, to a core audience.</p><div class=separator style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center"><a href=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TDBFK4Vspr0/TaLJxTiLP5I/AAAAAAAAAGA/EBHzEgrIO6U/s1600/rubix_cube_solved.jpg><img alt="A solved Rubix cube" src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TDBFK4Vspr0/TaLJxTiLP5I/AAAAAAAAAGA/EBHzEgrIO6U/s1600/rubix_cube_solved.jpg></a></div><p>This 'environmental' effect would require a different geometry to those available in ambisonics - i.e. more of a grid than a platonic cube. Like a rubik's cube, with each intersection&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic">between each mini-cube</span>&nbsp;furnished with loudspeakers. Ofcourse this in turn would require a different type of decoder.</p><p><strong>Jaaga</strong><br>The Jaaga building is modular, and large, and we have a maximum of 16 permanent loudspeakers for the building - some of which vary considerably in frequency range. The loudspeakers need to some extent to be distributed across the rooms, so one option would be to take 8 loudspeakers and set up an ambisonic room.</p><p>However the effect I'd like to achieve here would be the more environmental type - and specifically designed for a freely moving audience. We already have an irregular loudspeaker layout which takes into account various requirements:</p><ul style="text-align: left"><li>A clear sound environment for the large hall (downstairs) which can be useful for talks and screenings.&nbsp;</li><li>Two loudspeakers for the Jaagaad installation on the first floor.</li></ul><p>I don't want to force loudspeakers in the space to conform to a platonic solid. A geometry might be good, but rather one that is far more irregular (and explorable, and that relates somehow to the space).</p><p>Another option could be to develop a simple patch that combines a point from a 3D cartesian coordinate system with each mono sound. As the point associated with a mono sound closes in on a loudspeaker, the volume of that sound in that loudspeaker channel increases. Inspired by but different to ambisonics.</p><p>My next step could be to prototype this in Max/MSP and see how it works. But not to get too far ahead without considering the obvious: <span style="font-style: italic">Who else has done this before, and what were their results?</span></p></div><a class=read-more href=/blog/going-further-with-ambisonics>Read more &gt;</a><hr class=separator></article><ul id=paging class=cta><li><a href="/blog/page10/">&lt; Previous page</a></li><li><a href="/blog/page12/">Next page &gt;</a></li></ul></main><aside class=right><nav><header><h1>All posts</h1></header><h2 id=2015-ref>2015</h2><ul><li><a href=/blog/new-site-for-hardware-hack-lab>New Site for Hardware Hack Lab</a></li></ul><h2 id=2014-ref>2014</h2><ul><li><a href=/blog/sound-control-at-future-interfaces>Sound Control at Future Interfaces</a></li><li><a href=/blog/projection-masking-not-projection>Projection Masking, not Projection Mapping</a></li><li><a href=/blog/addon-for-openframeworks-kinect-v2-and>Addon for openFrameworks, Kinect V2 and Mac</a></li><li><a href=/blog/john-cleese-on-creativity>John Cleese on Creativity</a></li><li><a href=/blog/takeaways-from-eyeo-2014>Takeaways from Eyeo 2014</a></li><li><a href=/blog/hardware-hacker-culture-of-new-york>Hardware Hacker Culture of New York</a></li><li><a href=/blog/future-visions-for-human-interaction>Future Visions for Human Interaction</a></li><li><a href=/blog/openbci-nears-its-kickstarter-goal>OpenBCI Nears it's Kickstarter Goal</a></li></ul><h2 id=2013-ref>2013</h2><ul><li><a href=/blog/sound-chamber-2013>Sound Chamber (2013)</a></li><li><a href=/blog/openbci-hackathon-at-thoughtworks>OpenBCI Hackathon at ThoughtWorks</a></li><li><a href=/blog/exploring-depth-video-at-culturehub>Exploring Depth Video at CultureHub</a></li><li><a href=/blog/introduction-to-ibeacons>Introduction to iBeacons</a></li><li><a href=/blog/volumetric-lab-at-culturehub-nyc>Volumetric Lab at CultureHub NYC</a></li><li><a href=/blog/randomness-in-algorithm>Randomness in the Algorithm</a></li><li><a href=/blog/study-existential>Video: Existential</a></li><li><a href=/blog/the-visual-art-of-brian-eno>The Visual Art of Brian Eno</a></li><li><a href=/blog/rgbdtoolkit-sketch-at-sampler>RGBDToolkit Sketch at The Sampler</a></li><li><a href=/blog/the-artist-geek-hybrid>The Artist-Geek Hybrid</a></li><li><a href=/blog/rgbdtoolkit-calibration-tutorial>RGBDToolkit Calibration Tutorial</a></li><li><a href=/blog/how-depth-sensor-works-in-5-minutes>How a Depth Sensor Works -
