It's broadly due to a historical pig-headed lonership and lack of communal immersion, and also sparse and bias-driven field research which I am currently regretting and rectifying.</p><p>But I came across someone today who is hard not to fall in love with. An obvious choice some might say, but I have little knowledge of Brian Eno's work aside from a few clich√©s and only really came to this conclusion just now after watching <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00q9xqk>this quite personal documentary (Another Green World)</a>.</p><p><a href=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kdB15lj51KY/TUVHFXtjWRI/AAAAAAAAAD0/qCdlK5KMgq4/s1600/Arena+-+Brian+Eno+-+Another+Green+World+%252822+January+2010%2529%255BPDTV%2528XviD%2529%255D.avi_snapshot_10.52_%255B2011.01.29_22.44.17%255D.jpg style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em"><img alt="Brian Eno" height=180 src=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kdB15lj51KY/TUVHFXtjWRI/AAAAAAAAAD0/qCdlK5KMgq4/s320/Arena+-+Brian+Eno+-+Another+Green+World+%252822+January+2010%2529%255BPDTV%2528XviD%2529%255D.avi_snapshot_10.52_%255B2011.01.29_22.44.17%255D.jpg style="margin-left: 12px; margin-right: 12px" width=320></a>An ongoing concern of mine has been that I lack clear direction, darting from one subject or idea to another. I'm prone to explore and derail, explore and derail, in an endless cycle of optimism and eventual self-criticism and abandonment. The big exception to this rule has been programming, which as my bread and butter (my wage), has had an authoritative reason to retain a central role in my life.</p><p>As for my other interests, I begin by experimenting, and as soon as I see a few results roll in I become wildly optimistic. In very short time I find a large vision dominating my thoughts and slavishly set to the task of creating it. Along the way I lose my innocence regarding the project, and the ability to experiment or deviate, and eventually the will to see the project through.</p><p>It's only now that I write this that I start to realise that how I deal with this fear of a lack of direction could be part of the problem. When I'm thinking about how to spend my precious time, choosing one of the emerging visions as a "big plan" is a great way to help quell that fear. Of course, this process is subconscious - consciously I convince myself it's the strength of the plan that is the driving force. The actual effect of solidifying a plan early on is a personal disservice, converting the genuine interests that keep my mind engaged into tedious tasks. And if I don't finish the project, then the plan that was supposed to ensure my time was well-spent has had the opposite effect.</p><p>So what to do? How to rebuild confidence without following the same pattern? You can imagine I'm sure, that it's not much fun to wake up each day with no idea where to start, and no confidence that starting anything will get you anywhere. One option, I decided a while back, is that I should work collaboratively. In a month in Bangalore I'm due to start two such projects at <a href="http://www.jaaga.in/">Jaaga</a>. Forfeiting sole control of the process should help for now, but it's also dodging the question. What of working alone again?</p><p>The whole point is to enjoy it. So what about experimenting in discrete units, a day at a time, one technique at a time? Each day's work should be considered "throwaway," as it's real goal is development of practice, and blue-skies can't be blue-skies if it has a goal. These experiments can be shown as 'sketches' but a larger project can only be conceived much later (in some way I'm less familiar with, maybe in response to a commission, or pitch, or something with a budget attached).</p><p>Working this way seems obvious to some and I've been told it before, but I never took it quite to heart. After all the people who really have the power to change a person's freely chosen routine are strong role models, particularly older ones - and as I've mentioned, I had been lacking those.</p><p>The problem with this approach is that it seems counter-intuitive if you fear of lack of direction. Step in Eno:</p><blockquote><p>"... so instead of shooting arrows at somebody elses target, which i've never been very good at, I make my own target, around wherever my arrow happens to have landed... It's like you shoot an arrow and then you paint the bullseye around it."</p></blockquote><p>It was that quote which inspired this post. We'll see how it works out for me, but in the meantime, I highly recommend the documentary.</p></div><a class=read-more href=/blog/brian-eno-role-models-and-direction>Read more &gt;</a><hr class=separator></article><article role=article itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/BlogPosting><header><h1><a href=/blog/hype-cycle_17>The Hype Cycle</a></h1><div class=widgets>Posted on <time itemprop=dateCreated datetime=2011-01-17>Monday 17 January, 2011</time><ul class=social><li><a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=The%20Hype%20Cycle&amp;url=http://jahya.net/blog/hype-cycle_17&amp;via=hardwarehacklab"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=The%20Hype%20Cycle&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/hype-cycle_17"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&amp;t=The%20Hype%20Cycle&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/hype-cycle_17"><i class="fa fa-tumblr-square"></i></a></li></ul></div></header><div class=post-content><p>This is a really great diagram that I first saw at the <a href="http://node10.vvvv.org/">vvvv node10</a> event in Frankfurt.

It consisted of projecting video over a collection of large box-like surfaces arranged in a darkened room. I was happy with the general design of the space in my head, and when I got back to my hotel I wanted to sketch the image onto paper.</p><p>I drew a few lines, but then I was stuck. I can sketch just fine, but something was missing, from the image in my mind. I realised that my brain had performed a common trick - to conceive an object in terms of it's salient features, and to obscure or avoid the 'less important' ones. Ofcourse, for an artist, this is not good.</p><p>I got some modelling clay from my room, and tried to build a small model in 3D. Maybe this process would 'jog' these hidden features into being. I came up against the same problem - my conception was incomplete somehow. Ofcourse I could experiment and come up with a new design by working and reworking the clay, but the point is that this threw me, and I was curious.</p><p>I left it there and wasn't thinking about it until my new friend Karla started asking me what the clay boxes were for. When I explained she seemed unsurprised. She knew the problem: In order to reliably conceive objects in 3D space, you have to be in the practice of conceiving objects in 3D space! It's one of those ones that becomes incredibly obvious when someone points it out...</p><p>I felt a little silly for not seeing it this way in the first place. I had been thinking in terms of projection surfaces, in terms of content, in terms of user experience. I complain sometimes about struggling to create real-world objects for my software-driven installations, but I've been so distracted by software and concept and content that I've been neglecting this crucial concern for some time.</p><p>Karla began explaining that it's a common problem. When she teaches kids how to draw, the first thing she teaches them is to see the geometry behind the surface. If they are drawing an eyeball, she tells them to draw the sphere of the eye first, and then to draw the surface elements over the underlying shape. Karla suggested that I improve by both drawing and sculpting 3D objects. The hands are the key to the brain, and working materials with your hands gives the brain the tactile information it needs to envisage 3D objects concretely. Translating onto 2D helps with 'bringing the object in', inside your head.</p><p>She also pointed out that I don't have to worry too much about the overall aesthetic values - "You're not trying to be the next fuckin' Rodin" - quote of the week. It's more important to get a feel for the nature of basic geometries. This should help me with my boxes, and on into future installations.</p><p>I started to think about new questions about the installation. How do the boxes feel? Are they the same or different sizes? How much do they weigh? Where do they intersect with each other and what angles are created as a result?</p><p>Another issue this raises (that I am just realising now) is that where I had left room for research and experimentation with some elements of the piece, I had thought the physical layout fixed from the point of conception. So these questions above shouldn't be so that I can define all these qualities from the outset. They are there to provide me a starting point, an initial conception that is open to change, now that I am embracing the problem rather than trying to finalise it quickly so that I can forget about it.</p><p>So this feels like a good idea. I'll work on content and research, and at the same time begin trying to sculpt some small shapes. This also jogs another 'back of the mind' concern... I want to initiate a similar investigation into colour... but this is enough for one day - one thing at a time!</p></div><a class=read-more href=/blog/working-with-3d-space>Read more &gt;</a><hr class=separator></article><article role=article itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/BlogPosting><header><h1><a href=/blog/technology-and-luck>Technology and Luck</a></h1><div class=widgets>Posted on <time itemprop=dateCreated datetime=2010-11-16>Tuesday 16 November, 2010</time><ul class=social><li><a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=Technology%20and%20Luck&amp;url=http://jahya.net/blog/technology-and-luck&amp;via=hardwarehacklab"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Technology%20and%20Luck&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/technology-and-luck"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&amp;t=Technology%20and%20Luck&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/technology-and-luck"><i class="fa fa-tumblr-square"></i></a></li></ul></div></header><div class=post-content><p>I've had a terrible run of luck recently. Before two different shows, I've suddenly had a piece of hardware die on me.</p><p>The first one was a few weeks ago, my projector just wouldn't switch on. And I couldn't use any old projector as a replacement, it had to be a short throw with decent contrast ratio. Next, just two days ago, my laptop refused to login - this time just a few hours before the show was due to start. In both cases I had to cancel the show.</p><p>I was annoyed about my 'luck' on the days involved, but being skeptical about the idea of luck I'm determined to tighten up my practice to reduce the likelihood of being floored by similar problems in the future. The idiom that 'you make your own luck' appeals to me.</p><p>So where to start? The first obvious thing to think about is the extent to which I'm relying on technology as a whole. Having not experienced any crippling technology failures before, it was easy to avoid thinking about it until now. You plug things in and they work - generally. But it's time to realise that I don't have anything handmade I can pull out in replacement. The whole premise of my work relies on real-time processing. So technology failing is kind of a 'low risk high consequence' problem. It pays where possible to have work ready and tested on a backup computer, or other relevant backup hardware.</p><p>A couple of years ago I went to a Rafael Lozano-Hemmer show in London. All of the exhibits relied heavily on realtime technology, and when we arrived, two of the exhibits weren't working at all. Before we left the technicians had repaired one of them, but I found out that this had happened several times throughout the exhibition. Lozano Hemmer is a well-practised international artist and a big name. If this is a serious problem for him, then this is a serious problem.</p><p>This is the next thing to think about. The more technology involved the higher the likelihood of something failing at some point in time. It isn't always possible to carry two projectors and two laptops (and two of each animal) around the globe in case one of them fails. But if I carry two laptops, I should take the reasonable amount of time to make sure the software runs correctly on both, and I should do this in advance. This wouldn't eliminate the risk but it would reduce it significantly. If I had done this a week ago, I would have been able to salvage the second one of my shows.</p><p>There's a lot of 'should' in that last paragraph, and I think everybody knows how much easier it is to preach backups and redundancy than it is to follow through. But writing this post is part of an attempt to increase the value and importance of these practices in my mind. A little while down the road I suspect I'll be returning to this post and reflecting on whether or not things worked out.</p></div><a class=read-more href=/blog/technology-and-luck>Read more &gt;</a><hr class=separator></article><article role=article itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/BlogPosting><header><h1><a href=/blog/gallery-types-and-commercial-gallery>Different Types of Gallery</a></h1><div class=widgets>Posted on <time itemprop=dateCreated datetime=2010-10-25>Monday 25 October, 2010</time><ul class=social><li><a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=Different%20Types%20of%20Gallery&amp;url=http://jahya.net/blog/gallery-types-and-commercial-gallery&amp;via=hardwarehacklab"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Different%20Types%20of%20Gallery&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/gallery-types-and-commercial-gallery"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&amp;t=Different%20Types%20of%20Gallery&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/gallery-types-and-commercial-gallery"><i class="fa fa-tumblr-square"></i></a></li></ul></div></header><div class=post-content><p>A couple of days ago I found myself in the middle of a debate about commercial art galleries. Are they glorified dealers, selecting only art that fits a narrow, profit-oriented, white-cube ideal? Or are they operators in cultural cohesion, inviting community and collectors to share in the owner's artistic vision over a free beer at openings?</p><p><a href=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kdB15lj51KY/TMSPfUcfzKI/AAAAAAAAADk/lVZe98ozKqE/s1600/gallery.png style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em"><img alt="Abstract gallery photo" height=320 src=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_kdB15lj51KY/TMSPfUcfzKI/AAAAAAAAADk/lVZe98ozKqE/s320/gallery.png style="margin-left: 12px; margin-right: 12px" width=182></a>Well, the truth is they're probably both to an extent that varies from gallery to gallery. But it made me realise I don't really know how the gallery scene works, and it gave me the impetus to do a little bit of investigation. I've summarised it in this article, and discussed commercial galleries more below.</p><p>See the links at the bottom for the sources. And let me know if you have a different idea about how things work.</p><p><strong>Four Types</strong><br>Below are the four types I found that stood out. People usually rank these in levels of desirability for the artist, due to the potential for profit and prestige. Starting with the lowest:</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline">1. Vanity gallery</span><br>In this category the artist pays a fee to the gallery in order to show their work. Vanity galleries are particularly prevalent in big cities, and particularly in New York, because of it's status in the art world. It can cost between $2-10k depending on whether you use the space exclusively or not. These galleries often make a profit while the artist is making a loss, because a lot of aspiring artists want New York shows on their CV no matter how they have to get there. In reality it can damage the artist's career as these galleries are looked down on by people in the 'higher levels'.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline">2. Co-operative / artist run</span><br>A nice middle ground which will cost you less as an artist, is to buy into a cooperative. In doing so, you get a say in how the co-op is run (if you want), and you get a guaranteed slot for a show every 1-2 years when your turn comes up. It costs much less than a vanity show but the costs are ongoing rather than one-off, so it requires commitment - and you also need to convince the other artists in the collective that your work is worthy of joining the mix. It's also tougher to make a sale, since the real money is in the commercial galleries, but you get to be a part of something which is real and happening, and you can work with your peers, and network and share facilities.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline">3. Non-profit galleries</span><br>These look to me to be a good target for artists, though difficult to run for the owners. The non-profit is funded by donations and grants and it takes a lot of skill to establish and navigate. Sales of the artist's work usually include commissions for the institution, but the percentage is lower than with commercial galleries. If you are accepted you get to show and network in an environment that doesn't need to make sales to survive, which gives you and the gallery the freedom to take risks. However, particularly larger institutions may rely on funding from public sector sources, and need to emulate commercial galleries to appear to deserve it. A nice plus with non-profits is that you actually have a chance to get accepted based on merit alone, unlike any of the other models - because it's common for non-profits to put out open calls and accept unknown artists based on the proposal and portfolio alone.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline">4. Independently owned / Commercial gallery</span><br>The benefit of working with a commercial gallery is relative stability and an improved financial situation - you have a dealer working on your behalf who stands to make just as much money from each sale as you (circa 50% commission). This is a plus and a minus though, as it means ensuring your output fits within known market limitations - you <span style="font-style: bold">can</span> push the edges sometimes but it's harder to take risks because the gallery relies exclusively on sales of your work to survive. If you don't sell, they can't pay the rent, the staff, or the bills.</p><p><a href=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kdB15lj51KY/TMSINdsAITI/AAAAAAAAADg/1LLuz89bQvQ/s1600/IMG_6844.jpg style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em"><img alt="Abstract gallery photo" height=240 src=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kdB15lj51KY/TMSINdsAITI/AAAAAAAAADg/1LLuz89bQvQ/s320/IMG_6844.jpg style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 12px; margin-top: 20px" width=320></a>The gallery may well have been started off by an artist or enthusiastic collector, and there will usually be some kind of 'house style' they are keen to nurture - which will be why they chose you in the first place. So in many respects they are on 'your side'. But they must always wear the hat of the dealer too.</p><p>At the higher end of the commercial gallery scene (where the serious money is made) the community becomes more tight-knit, and has a 'club-like mentality'. Collectors, artists and dealers are more generally known to each other, and artists are selected from this pool. You won't get to display in any of these galleries from the outside - to even approach any of these people you need to find a way into the social group first. From there it seems you keep networking until you are noticed by a gallery that likes you.</p><p><strong>What effect will working for commercial galleries have on your art?</strong><br>Here I'm starting to descend more into opinion. It seems to be that one of the first things that makes an item saleable is it's relationship to other art. In particular the placement of the object in accordance with a lineage of art - art history and art future. So the gallery will play up that angle by making references to prominent art movements, critics, practitioners or establishments - a form of value by association. In the modern, pluralistic art market, I think this criterion alone can be satisfied with almost art object. Doing so may obscure it's essence to some extent, but that's just part of the sales process.</p><p>A more problematic one though, is that you need to have at least a certain percentage of saleable artifacts. And they have to have a certain level of workmanship or material quality about them so that they would look 'right' hung on a wall or existing in a contemporary-looking space, which may often be a high-end living space. This is a problem in my field, new media, as well as fields like performance art or video art. They are just too ephemeral and documentation of an event or instance just don't have the same aura as the event itself. So this will place size, aesthetic and material constraints on at least some of your work, to an extent that depends on the gallery.</p><p>And then there's the 'sales environment' constraints - the gallery space itself. The work needs to have a 'sacred' aura around it, which adds to the sense of value. (This is because of the 'cult of art genius' which has continued strongly to resonate with buyers since it's inception during the Renaissance.) This is the reason for the white walls, the hushed tone, and the general sense of awkwardness for people who aren't used to that environment. Making them feel awkward is a side-effect of making collectors feel at ease - this is 'high' culture, more suitable for 'refined' taste. It also explains why there are no prices on the walls - after all, there could be - the items are fixed price after all. But this refined aura would be broken by any overt sense of commerciality on the gallerist's part.</p><p><strong>Is this a Good Thing or a Bad Thing?</strong><br>You might think of these things as 'restrictions', and think that restrictions on art can only be a 'Bad Thing'. But in a way, it's kind of inevitable. You can think of this as a cultural reflection on how we view art, mixed with growing, insistent global market forces. The cultural perspective is a hand-me-down from the Western tradition of the last 400 years - the notion of artistic genius, the masters of form. Interestingly, it seems that whatever new art movements come along to overthrow any existing establishment, what comes out at the end is a new establishment. In contemporary academic circles, distinctions such as 'high' art are now frowned on as elitist and monocultural, and academically speaking this notion died with the rise of Post-Modernism. But in reality high art now means high price rather than high culture - it's a huge international market now, and artistic prestige is affirmed as much by the ticket price as by academic criticism.</p><p>On the other hand, it's a market that artists can tap into and make money from - it's an option, not a compulsion. Therefore these aren't 'restrictions' but choices, and for many types of artist, these choices fit in well enough with their practice. I'm sure some artists might produce work purely to satisfy the market, without any sense of personal interjection, but i'd suspect these are in the minority. To illustrate, note the&nbsp;assumption running through this article so far that artists are only interested in selling to collectors. If you wanted to sell to the public at large, there would be even more 'restrictions' on what you could do - considerably more. Experimental, and 'cutting edge' work is a niche thing that appeals to a thin slaver of academics and wealthy people. That's the context that all of this sits in.</p><p>So on reflection, I don't want to attack the commercial gallery - I just think there are other ways to make money.&nbsp;Due to the nature of my activity, I don't think commercial galleries are going to work for me. I'll look into non-profits, co-ops, and 'other' - more in another post.</p><p><strong>Sources</strong></p><ul><li><a href=http://artistemerging.blogspot.com/2006/09/types-of-galleries.html>Deanna's post</a> from 'Artist, Emerging' blog</li><li>Art-tistics on <a href="http://blog.art-tistics.com/?p=160">vanity galleries</a></li><li>Art-tistics on <a href="http://blog.art-tistics.com/?p=161">co-operatives</a></li><li>Art-tistics on <a href="http://blog.art-tistics.com/?p=159">commercial galleries</a></li><li>Limner on&nbsp;<a href=http://www.slowart.com/limner/htm/york.htm>the gallery scene</a></li><li>Art Bistro on <a href=http://artbistro.monster.com/news/articles/7528-the-411-on-non-profit-galleries>non-profits</a></li></ul></div><a class=read-more href=/blog/gallery-types-and-commercial-gallery>Read more &gt;</a><hr class=separator></article><article role=article itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/BlogPosting><header><h1><a href=/blog/jason-bruges-studio>Jason Bruges Studio</a></h1><div class=widgets>Posted on <time itemprop=dateCreated datetime=2010-10-12>Tuesday 12 October, 2010</time><ul class=social><li><a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=Jason%20Bruges%20Studio&amp;url=http://jahya.net/blog/jason-bruges-studio&amp;via=hardwarehacklab"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Jason%20Bruges%20Studio&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/jason-bruges-studio"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&amp;t=Jason%20Bruges%20Studio&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/jason-bruges-studio"><i class="fa fa-tumblr-square"></i></a></li></ul></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Jason Bruges is a well-known name in the interactive arts &amp; architecture in the UK. Nine years ago he started a studio that:</p><blockquote><p>"create[s] interactive spaces and surfaces that sit between the worlds of architecture, interaction design and site-specific installation art. Our projects range from large-scale building facades and public art to interactive interior environments and products"</p></blockquote><p>There is a whole team (17 credited on the website), producing under this name and they take on a number of large scale commissions in any given year.</p><div style="text-align: center"><iframe frameborder=0 height=359 src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/9809019?byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width=525></iframe></div><p>Looking through the 2009/2010 work, there seems to a preoccupation with repeating forms, particularly illuminated forms. The form could be LED/OLED's, pandas, glass panels, or so on - but they are always arranged in a simple pattern or series, most commonly a 2 dimensional grid. Each repeated item has the capacity to move or illuminate, but no one form is ever dominant over another in terms of it's abilities or importance. Each form is only different from each of it's peers by virtue of it's location within the space.</p><p>This 'equal rights' placement of forms reminds me of the pixels in a computer screen. All have the same capabilities, but and their state at any given moment is a function of their position with respect to all other pixels.</p><p>In work like the <a href=http://www.jasonbruges.com/projects/uk-projects/platform-5>Platform 5</a>&nbsp;installation, at Sunderland Station in the UK, this metaphor is almost too indistinct to be called a metaphor. In work like <a href=http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/jason-bruges-studio-wind-to-light.html>Wind to Light</a>, this metaphor is stretched. Each light is powered by something beyond the control of the installation - the weather. So it's not just responding to the environment - it's life (i.e. it's power source) <span style=font-style:italic>depends</span> on the environment. Which explains why when I went to see it, there was nothing there! The weather was too calm.</p><p>What does hold is the concept of autonomous units, whose potential for contribution to the whole is no more or less than that of each of it's peers. This appears to be one of the calling cards of Bruges work. This article is the first in a series of short written investigations into major studios, and i'm interested to see how commonly i'll find this concept in other work.</p></div><a class=read-more href=/blog/jason-bruges-studio>Read more &gt;</a><hr class=separator></article><ul id=paging class=cta><li><a href="/blog/page12/">&lt; Previous page</a></li><li><a href="/blog/page14/">Next page &gt;</a></li></ul></main><aside class=right><nav><header><h1>All posts</h1></header><h2 id=2015-ref>2015</h2><ul><li><a href=/blog/new-site-for-hardware-hack-lab>New Site for Hardware Hack Lab</a></li></ul><h2 id=2014-ref>2014</h2><ul><li><a href=/blog/sound-control-at-future-interfaces>Sound Control at Future Interfaces</a></li><li><a href=/blog/projection-masking-not-projection>Projection Masking, not Projection Mapping</a></li><li><a href=/blog/addon-for-openframeworks-kinect-v2-and>Addon for openFrameworks, Kinect V2 and Mac</a></li><li><a href=/blog/john-cleese-on-creativity>John Cleese on Creativity</a></li><li><a href=/blog/takeaways-from-eyeo-2014>Takeaways from Eyeo 2014</a></li><li><a href=/blog/hardware-hacker-culture-of-new-york>Hardware Hacker Culture of New York</a></li><li><a href=/blog/future-visions-for-human-interaction>Future Visions for Human Interaction</a></li><li><a href=/blog/openbci-nears-its-kickstarter-goal>OpenBCI Nears it's Kickstarter Goal</a></li></ul><h2 id=2013-ref>2013</h2><ul><li><a href=/blog/sound-chamber-2013>Sound Chamber (2013)</a></li><li><a href=/blog/openbci-hackathon-at-thoughtworks>OpenBCI Hackathon at ThoughtWorks</a></li><li><a href=/blog/exploring-depth-video-at-culturehub>Exploring Depth Video at CultureHub</a></li><li><a href=/blog/introduction-to-ibeacons>Introduction to iBeacons</a></li><li><a href=/blog/volumetric-lab-at-culturehub-nyc>Volumetric Lab at CultureHub NYC</a></li><li><a href=/blog/randomness-in-algorithm>Randomness in the Algorithm</a></li><li><a href=/blog/study-existential>Video: Existential</a></li><li><a href=/blog/the-visual-art-of-brian-eno>The Visual Art of Brian Eno</a></li><li><a href=/blog/rgbdtoolkit-sketch-at-sampler>RGBDToolkit Sketch at The Sampler</a></li><li><a href=/blog/the-artist-geek-hybrid>The Artist-Geek Hybrid</a></li><li><a href=/blog/rgbdtoolkit-calibration-tutorial>RGBDToolkit Calibration Tutorial</a></li><li><a href=/blog/how-depth-sensor-works-in-5-minutes>How a Depth Sensor Works -
