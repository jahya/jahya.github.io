Here are the results.</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>First, I searched Youtube for a gentle intro. This 'man-in-white-coat' video from the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union>EBU</a>&nbsp;is perfect. In it, the 3D sound concept behind ambisonics is introduced and discussed.</p><div style="text-align: center"><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=328 src=http://www.youtube.com/embed/C0xRAf9-XeU title="YouTube video player" width=538></iframe></div><p>They also introduce the notion of first-order (4-channel) vs. higher-order (multichannel) ambisonics, and&nbsp;mention ambisonic's lack of compatibility to 2-channel sound. They say that in first-order ambisonics, just 4 audio channels can be interpreted to give "any number of loudspeaker signals that we need", but they don't explain how.</p><p><strong>Advantages and Disadvantages</strong><br>To get a little further, I went to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambisonics>Wikipedia</a>. Here we have a nice list of advantages and disadvantages, which i'll paraphrase:</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Advantages</span></p><ul style="text-align: left"><li>Sounds from any direction are treated equally (not favouring front &amp; side - i.e. it's <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropy>isotropic</a>), leading to better soundfield 'imaging'</li><li>A minimum of 4 channels are required (first-order)</li><li>Loudspeakers do not have to be arranged in a rigid setting, thier placement can vary (within 'sensible' limits)</li><li>The ambisonic signal is independent of the replay system - i.e. you can record / synthesize once and replay on any ambisonic-compatible loudspeaker arrangement</li></ul><p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Disadvantages</span></p><ul style="text-align: left"><li>Not supported by any major label or media company - never marketed, largely unknown outside academic circles</li><li>Conceptually different to traditional 1 speaker per setup approaches, so small learning curve</li><li>Needs to be decoded from storage format (called B-Format) into your loudspeaker environment. Hardware boxes or software can do this.</li><li>Number of speakers vs. size of space: "... if the listening area is too large then, without treatment, the resulting soundfield can approach the limits of stability. This has resulted in some unimpressive demos"</li></ul><p><strong>B-format and Channel Roles</strong><br>Later in the article it describes how the storage format works and what each channel does:</p><blockquote><p>"[In first-order Ambisonics], sound information is encoded into four channels: <span style="font-style: italic">W</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">X</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Y</span>and Z. This is called Ambisonic B-format. The <span style="font-style: italic">W</span> channel is the non-directional mono component of the signal, corresponding to the output of an omnidirectional microphone. The <span style="font-style: italic">X</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Y</span>and <span style="font-style: italic">Z</span>channels are the directional components in three dimensions. They correspond to the outputs of three figure-of-eight microphones, facing forward, to the left, and upward respectively."</p></blockquote><p>So with a four-channel file we have a mono channel and 3 positioning channels. What this doesn't tell me is exactly what data are stored in those three positioning channels, and how they are used to coax the information from a mono channel into a 3D space. I think I'm going to come back to this later though, I want to learn more about the listening space for now.</p><p><strong>The Listening Space</strong><br>The first thing on my mind is, how does B-Format translate into the listening space? Is B-Format enough to allow multiple moving sounds to move separately throughout the space, or only one?</p><p>I came across an excellent set of tutorials by a guy named Bruce Wiggins from University of Derby, UK. There are five videos, each in lecture / presentation style, designed for the beginner, which is perfect.&nbsp;The presentations talk in reference to a software product called Reaper, which even if we don't use, is interesting all the same.</p><ul style="text-align: left"><li><a href=http://uod-true-multi-channel-mixing.wikispaces.com/Reaper+Tutorial+Videos>Links to the five tutorial videos</a></li></ul><p>One of the presentation screens contains a diagram that seems to answer my question:</p><div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center"><a href=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EJyvtXMpXR8/TZnDG5PHqVI/AAAAAAAAAFg/66VzlCBaBiY/s1600/ambi.png style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img alt="A diagram showing the encoding and decoding process" height=112 src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EJyvtXMpXR8/TZnDG5PHqVI/AAAAAAAAAFg/66VzlCBaBiY/s400/ambi.png width=400></a></div><p>This diagram shows how to encode separate audio tracks to a single B-Format file, and then how to decode that file into a multichannel listening space. In Bruce's words:</p><blockquote><p>"During the encoding process each source is panned, and then sent to [an encoder bus] where it is summed with the other panned sources, decoded, and then sent to the speakers.</p></blockquote><p>The videos continue into practical sessions.</p><p><strong>Decoding and Encoding</strong><br>Bruce begins by creating a track for the decoder. He sets it to be a 4-channel in, 8-channel out track and routes each output to a loudspeaker. He attaches a VST plugin to do the decoding from a 4-channel B-Format bus to the 8-channel listening space. (Bruce then switches to quad out for demo purposes over a stereo video, but the principal is there.)</p><p>The next stage is to add B-Busses, again as separate tracks, and to connect them to the decoder using Sends. In this case he creates a track for a reverb send, a track for the original 'dry' recording, and a track to sum the two together ready for the decoder.</p><p>Finally, Bruce creates a track representing a mono-in, and attaches a VST Encoder so that it outputs in B-Format. He then Sends this track to the dry / reverb B-Busses.</p><p>This answers a question I had been mulling over - given a mono audio track, where does the pan information come from? In this case, the pan information is added to the mono track via the VST Encoder plugin interface. You could add it in real-time, record it, or automate it. This is because we are encoding from a mono source - if you were using ambisonic recordings, the hardware would have written the B-Format for you and you wouldn't need an Encoder.</p><p><strong>Questions</strong><br>That's enough for an intro. The questions it leaves me pondering:</p><ol style="text-align: left"><li>Notably all of Bruce's decoder options assume a specific (and quite lab-oriented) loudspeaker setup, i.e. a perfect octagon with all speakers at a specific angle. I will have to look further into how to handle much more 'random' listening spaces.</li><li>Similarly, the panning options in his VST encoder use Azimuth and Elevation. It seems that in order to get a nice 3D effect more appropriate options would be X, Y and Z co-ordinates? However it may be that the controls provided here are enough.</li><li>Less important immediately, but how do the B-Format XYZ busses relate to the W bus? What data specifically do they store? And for example, if&nbsp;Audio Track 1 and Audio Track 2 contained the same frequencies but were in different XYZ locations, how does the mixdown process work? I have a feeling the answer may be 'just the same as mixing in stereo', but it's hard after years of thinking in terms of two channels to immediately make that leap, and I need to get into the XYZ bus data to really get that.</li><li>What changes when we delve into higher-order ambisonics? Does this improve the 'resolution' or some other factors aswell?</li><li>And ofcourse, what are the different ways of working associated with other applications / plugins / environments, i.e. Max/MSP? I think this is the next question to answer, as I have a feeling that exploring that will answer some of the questions above.</li></ol><p>See the follow-up article here: <a href=//blog/going-further-with-ambisonics>Going Further with Ambisonics</a></p></div><a class=read-more href=/blog/introduction-to-ambisonics>Read more &gt;</a><hr class=separator></article><article role=article itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/BlogPosting><header><h1><a href=/blog/surface-light-sound-installation>Surface (2010)</a></h1><div class=widgets>Posted on <time itemprop=dateCreated datetime=2011-04-01>Friday 1 April, 2011</time><ul class=social><li><a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=Surface%20(2010)&amp;url=http://jahya.net/blog/surface-light-sound-installation&amp;via=hardwarehacklab"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Surface%20(2010)&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/surface-light-sound-installation"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&amp;t=Surface%20(2010)&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/surface-light-sound-installation"><i class="fa fa-tumblr-square"></i></a></li></ul></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Surface is a light and sound installation created for Jaaga in 2010.

Unfortunately there isn't a NYU phys comp tutorial on driving servo motors with high voltages, which would have been ideal. I've had to learn a few new things, from a mixture of sources, and I'll pull the results together here.</p><p><strong>The difference between standard geared motors and servo motors</strong><br>So the first thing to understand is that a geared DC motor like the ones we used in the last couple of posts is quite dumb. It is directly controlled by the DC current you supply it via it's two inputs. You can only really tell it to start or stop. That's it.</p><p>You can vary the speed using <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation>PWM</a> - but PWM is a kind of microcontroller 'hack' in a sense. What's really happening there is that you are very quickly turning it on and off, and varying the delay between those on and off commands. The motor itself doesn't have any control in that process - it just spins when it receives voltage in one of it's inputs.</p><p>If you wanted to be able to tell the motor to turn <span style="font-style: italic">to a specific angle</span>, you'd have to attach a sensor (i.e. a potentiometer) to the shaft. This could report the current angle of the shaft back to the microcontroller. You could use this information to figure out when to switch off the current to the motor to have it arrive at your desired destination on time.</p><p>And this is exactly what a servo motor does, except rather than reporting the position back to the microcontroller and you having to work it out, you just send the position you would like it to achieve, and it does all the working out for you. For this reason, unlike the standard geared DC motors, it has three inputs - one for ground, one for V+, and one to send your control signal.</p><p><strong>When to use a H-Bridge and when to use a TIP120?</strong><br>Tobias, and my <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Physical-Computing-Sensing-Controlling-Computers/dp/159200346X>Physical Computing book</a> all seem to suggest I need a TIP120, not an L293 H-Bridge (which is what I used when connecting the motors in the previous posts). The question is, why?</p><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style="float: right; text-align: right; margin-left: 1em"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2byTdRfKQP4/TY4BvykiE0I/AAAAAAAAAFI/s3-RitTb_bU/s1600/L293_h-bridge.JPG style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><img alt="An L293 H-Bridge" height=184 src=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2byTdRfKQP4/TY4BvykiE0I/AAAAAAAAAFI/s3-RitTb_bU/s200/L293_h-bridge.JPG width=200></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">L293 H-Bridge</td></tr></tbody></table><p>First off, what is a H-Bridge? And what is a TIP120?&nbsp;Going back to the beginning of the chapter (page 97), I get a brief explanation that of what a relay is and what a transistor is. It explains that a relay is an electromagnet that flicks a switch for you whenever you send a control current to it (i.e. it's a switch that doesn't need to be flicked by a person, you can flick it automatically in your microcontroller code). It then just says that a transistor does the same thing but doesn't have any moving parts, and so is quicker - but will only work with DC.</p><p>With some googling I find that the TIP120 and the L293 have something in common. The L293 H-Bridge <span style="font-style: italic">contains</span> transistors, and the TIP120 <span style="font-style: italic">is a</span> transistor. So it seems that driving powerful loads is all about transistors - using a control current to switch on and off a powerful current.</p><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class=tr-caption-container style="float: right; text-align: right; margin-left: 1em"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-o4QAeSke-pg/TY4BndRVLMI/AAAAAAAAAFE/JEx8oxYAeTs/s1600/tip120_transistor.JPG style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><img alt="A TIP120 transistor" height=200 src=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-o4QAeSke-pg/TY4BndRVLMI/AAAAAAAAAFE/JEx8oxYAeTs/s200/tip120_transistor.JPG width=189></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">TIP120 Transistor</td></tr></tbody></table><p>So this is the information I need to really make it make sense. Both components only allow you to switch higher-load circuits on or off. A standard geared DC motor is spun one way or another by alternating the direction of DC current through it's two connections. This is what an L293 H-Bridge is useful for, as it gives you two output legs to the motor, through which you can send HIGH to one and LOW to the other and vice versa.</p><p>However a servo motor only requires a a high voltage to give it some power to work with. The control signal can then be used as an enable pin, and then instead of blindly increasing and decreasing speed through PWM, you vary the speed and direction by using a second control signal that goes straight to the motor. The motor does the dirty work for you, and as a result you get a direct correlation between the value you send it and the location the shaft turns to - no wonder they are more expensive. So for this, a single transistor is required - like the TIP120.</p><p>It took a lot of effort to piece that together! Tomorrow hopefully I can actually build the circuit.</p></div><a class=read-more href=/blog/running-servo-motor>Read more &gt;</a><hr class=separator></article><article role=article itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/BlogPosting><header><h1><a href=/blog/spinning-12v-dc-motor>Spinning a 12V DC Motor</a></h1><div class=widgets>Posted on <time itemprop=dateCreated datetime=2011-03-23>Wednesday 23 March, 2011</time><ul class=social><li><a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=Spinning%20a%2012V%20DC%20Motor&amp;url=http://jahya.net/blog/spinning-12v-dc-motor&amp;via=hardwarehacklab"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Spinning%20a%2012V%20DC%20Motor&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/spinning-12v-dc-motor"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&amp;t=Spinning%20a%2012V%20DC%20Motor&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/spinning-12v-dc-motor"><i class="fa fa-tumblr-square"></i></a></li></ul></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Yesterday, we tested a fairly timid 5V DC Motor with Arduino, and I <a href=//blog/spinning-dc-motor>blogged about the experience of setting it up and figuring out the components</a>.</p><p>Today we used exactly the same circuit, but switched to a more powerful 12V DC Motor which we picked up in SP Road for 175INR (£2.50).

Today we set up a simple circuit to drive a DC motor back and forth. We googled and found an <a href=http://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/Labs/DCMotorControl>online guide from a physical computing course at New York University</a>, which was really helpful, and you should definitely check it out if you want to build this circuit.</p><p>It's pretty cool how much easier it is nowadays to find very friendly guides for beginners. In particular I like how they use a standardised Arduino graphic instead of dry schematics, which are great for being concise but offputting to the uninitiated.</p><div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em"><a href=https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ysqCifwcMIU/TYhmH3a6pOI/AAAAAAAAAE4/N1IBJj-g01I/s1600/IMG_2636.JPG style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img alt="Me, working on the circuit" height=150 src=https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ysqCifwcMIU/TYhmH3a6pOI/AAAAAAAAAE4/N1IBJj-g01I/s200/IMG_2636.JPG width=200></a><a href=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NbBMbnlf5rs/TYhmO6w55wI/AAAAAAAAAE8/KXaD0HiEJyE/s1600/IMG_2645.JPG style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img alt="A photo of the circuit" height=150 src=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NbBMbnlf5rs/TYhmO6w55wI/AAAAAAAAAE8/KXaD0HiEJyE/s200/IMG_2645.JPG width=200></a></div><p>The pushbutton on the top left of the breadboard is just there to change the polarity, i.e. the direction of the motor. It's essentially seperate from the rest of the circuit so we can ignore it and look to the rest.</p><p>The H-Bridge (the chip in the middle) looks a little scary to begin, especially when you first glance the graphic associated with it (below). But once you take the time to look over what each leg actually does, then you start to get a bit more comfortable.</p><p>The H-Bridge's job is to allow a motor which requires a high load (i.e. 5-15V) to be controlled by a control signal (i.e. the Arduino standard 5V). In this case the motor we are using accepts 5V but we're going to set up a circuit that will allow the use of more powerful motors, so that we can just switch the 5V for a 10 or 12V motor later... hence the need for the H-Bridge.</p><p>So since the H-Bridge just has to translate 5V control signals to 5-15V motor signals, what ins and outs might it need? You might expect one leg to go to the external 5-15V power source, one to ground, one to +5V, two to the motor, and one control signal to the Arduino.</p><div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em"><a href=https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-iWv_U0rbiRU/TYho8Zq8gjI/AAAAAAAAAFA/24A1ALFWxSg/s1600/hbridge_labpinout.jpg style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img alt="L293 H-Bridge diagram" height=191 src=https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-iWv_U0rbiRU/TYho8Zq8gjI/AAAAAAAAAFA/24A1ALFWxSg/s320/hbridge_labpinout.jpg width=320></a></div><p>As the diagram shows, in reality things are a little different. The two that go to the motor are there - marked as 'Motor Terminal 1' and 'Motor Terminal 2'. The one that goes to the power supply is there too, marked 'VCC2'. But there are four legs that go to ground! This is according to the schematic and also the imagery in <a href=http://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/Labs/DCMotorControl>the guide</a>. I don't know why yet, but that's OK - four it is.</p><p>The next odd thing is that we have not one but THREE control signals - i.e. legs that go to the Arduino's digital out pins - which are pins 1, 2 and 7 above. The reason is that in order to turn the motor one way you use the two 'Motor Logic Pins' and send HIGH to one and LOW to the other. When you want to reverse the motor, send the opposite - LOW to one and HIGH to the other.</p><p>The third control pin, (pin 1 in the diagram), is an enable switch. If it receives HIGH the motor will work, otherwise it will not. So you can connect it to a constant +5V or set it programmatically in the microcontroller code. It functions as a programmatic on/off switch or safety-off, i.e. like the big red buttons on heavy machinery.</p><p>And the pins that aren't connected to anything on the right-hand side of the H-Bridge? The H-Bridge can control two motors at once if you want, just mirror the pin setup you have on the left to the right.</p><p>Fun, geeky stuff. We'll pick up a more powerful motor to play with later today. Here's the final result for today:</p><div style="text-align: center"><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=328 src=http://www.youtube.com/embed/1eLHR8fjxyg title="YouTube video player" width=538></iframe></div></div><a class=read-more href=/blog/spinning-dc-motor>Read more &gt;</a><hr class=separator></article><article role=article itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/BlogPosting><header><h1><a href=/blog/first-week-at-jaaga>First Week at Jaaga</a></h1><div class=widgets>Posted on <time itemprop=dateCreated datetime=2011-03-22>Tuesday 22 March, 2011</time><ul class=social><li><a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=First%20Week%20at%20Jaaga&amp;url=http://jahya.net/blog/first-week-at-jaaga&amp;via=hardwarehacklab"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=First%20Week%20at%20Jaaga&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/first-week-at-jaaga"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&amp;t=First%20Week%20at%20Jaaga&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/first-week-at-jaaga"><i class="fa fa-tumblr-square"></i></a></li></ul></div></header><div class=post-content><p>I'm one full week in to my residency at Jaaga, so what have I been doing?</p><p><a href=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jBYEVZLco8c/TYdsGMGAgrI/AAAAAAAAAEk/76lJOxEpO78/s1600/IMG_2532.JPG style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img alt="Buying components for Jaaga" height=150 src=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jBYEVZLco8c/TYdsGMGAgrI/AAAAAAAAAEk/76lJOxEpO78/s200/IMG_2532.JPG style="cursor: move" width=200></a>First off, introductions! I gave a short informal presentation of my work to the Jaaga crew, and began preparing and editing video for a public presentation in week 2.</p><p><a href=https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xLIvYG8MCmI/TYdr6x67JXI/AAAAAAAAAEc/wFMzSHaAqhI/s1600/IMG_2534.JPG style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img alt="Buying components for Jaaga" height=150 src=https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-xLIvYG8MCmI/TYdr6x67JXI/AAAAAAAAAEc/wFMzSHaAqhI/s200/IMG_2534.JPG width=200></a>I met up with my collaborators on Jaaga Light &amp; Sound, (<a href="http://agnesemosconi.co.uk/">Agnese Mosconi</a> and <a href="http://www.tobiasrosenberger.de/">Tobias Rosenberger</a>). They had already kicked off a series of workshops to stimulate involvement from Bangaloreans, which we continued this week. We cover topics from Arduino to Max/MSP and encourage the guys to contribute ideas for Jaaga.</p><p><a href=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-RLrkRNOyeBA/TYdsABbk0DI/AAAAAAAAAEg/cc2hsBFnvfc/s1600/IMG_2523.JPG style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img alt="The shopping list!" height=200 src=https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-RLrkRNOyeBA/TYdsABbk0DI/AAAAAAAAAEg/cc2hsBFnvfc/s200/IMG_2523.JPG width=150></a>The workshops are open to anyone and we get a nice mix of people. They range from graphic design students with zero electronics experience through to advanced hackers (many are techs from some of the many big R&amp;D centres that multinantional corporations have built here in recent years). These guys already have very advanced skills and are looking for cool projects to get involved in, so I've been focusing initially on getting the newbies up to scratch.</p><p>To facilitate the workshops and experiments we took a visit to SP Road to stock up on components and tools.</p><p>We are searching now for composer(s) to work with us on the sound aspect of the project, so get in touch if you are in Bangalore and compose using Ableton or any other software we can send control signals to (via OSC for example)... we'd like to hear from you!</p><p>And to round the week off was the Indian celebration of Holi - the festival of colour. For the wealthy this seems to mean getting made up and elegantly applying a dash of colour. But for a lot of people it means randomly tossing dye all over your friends. So my new roommate Mandy &amp; I walked the streets looking for trouble.

It's something all resident artists have to do when they start. Its not really something I've done much before, and I wasn't 100% on how to do it.</p><p>The people watching were mainly other participants at Jaaga so I asked for feedback immediately afterwards - knowing I may have to give the same presentation again soon, and more publicly this time. I'm glad I asked now as the feedback was very useful.</p><ul style="text-align: left"><li>I talked about my background as an agency programmer, and then talked about music compositions and installation artworks I had produced. It was suggested I could explain this progression, i.e. what were the motivations behind these changes?</li></ul><ul style="text-align: left"><li>I wasn't sure how to frame a tech-heavy background to a non-tech audience. It was suggested I could show a couple of website front-ends as visual aids and talk a little about what what the software did, by reference to software they may be familiar with, like blogger / wordpress.</li></ul><ul style="text-align: left"><li>For the later parts where I play video / media, I had a tendency to play a video and talk over it (!) and then skip onto the next video when I was done, without checking if the audience understood or needed more information. I also only offered scant clues to the context or concept behind each work.</li></ul><p>For the last one about video, it was suggested I use the following process:</p><ul><li>Talk first about the context and / or concept behind the work, before hitting play</li><li>Then play the media to illustrate what resulted from that context</li><li>Pause afterwards before continuing to the next project, and try to make people feel comfortable to ask questions</li></ul><p>It's funny, the feedback I got seems obvious in hindsight - It's the same things I've thought watching some other people's presentations in the past. But it's somehow a different story when you're standing in front of people and you're not sure what they expect. At the end of the day you have to keep a conversation going which all parties are interested in. And you can do that by expressing a clear narrative, and offering opportunities for feedback into the process.</p><p>Looking forward to improving this process next time.</p></div><a class=read-more href=/blog/presentation-style>Read more &gt;</a><hr class=separator></article><ul id=paging class=cta><li><a href="/blog/page11/">&lt; Previous page</a></li><li><a href="/blog/page13/">Next page &gt;</a></li></ul></main><aside class=right><nav><header><h1>All posts</h1></header><h2 id=2015-ref>2015</h2><ul><li><a href=/blog/new-site-for-hardware-hack-lab>New Site for Hardware Hack Lab</a></li></ul><h2 id=2014-ref>2014</h2><ul><li><a href=/blog/sound-control-at-future-interfaces>Sound Control at Future Interfaces</a></li><li><a href=/blog/projection-masking-not-projection>Projection Masking, not Projection Mapping</a></li><li><a href=/blog/addon-for-openframeworks-kinect-v2-and>Addon for openFrameworks, Kinect V2 and Mac</a></li><li><a href=/blog/john-cleese-on-creativity>John Cleese on Creativity</a></li><li><a href=/blog/takeaways-from-eyeo-2014>Takeaways from Eyeo 2014</a></li><li><a href=/blog/hardware-hacker-culture-of-new-york>Hardware Hacker Culture of New York</a></li><li><a href=/blog/future-visions-for-human-interaction>Future Visions for Human Interaction</a></li><li><a href=/blog/openbci-nears-its-kickstarter-goal>OpenBCI Nears it's Kickstarter Goal</a></li></ul><h2 id=2013-ref>2013</h2><ul><li><a href=/blog/sound-chamber-2013>Sound Chamber (2013)</a></li><li><a href=/blog/openbci-hackathon-at-thoughtworks>OpenBCI Hackathon at ThoughtWorks</a></li><li><a href=/blog/exploring-depth-video-at-culturehub>Exploring Depth Video at CultureHub</a></li><li><a href=/blog/introduction-to-ibeacons>Introduction to iBeacons</a></li><li><a href=/blog/volumetric-lab-at-culturehub-nyc>Volumetric Lab at CultureHub NYC</a></li><li><a href=/blog/randomness-in-algorithm>Randomness in the Algorithm</a></li><li><a href=/blog/study-existential>Video: Existential</a></li><li><a href=/blog/the-visual-art-of-brian-eno>The Visual Art of Brian Eno</a></li><li><a href=/blog/rgbdtoolkit-sketch-at-sampler>RGBDToolkit Sketch at The Sampler</a></li><li><a href=/blog/the-artist-geek-hybrid>The Artist-Geek Hybrid</a></li><li><a href=/blog/rgbdtoolkit-calibration-tutorial>RGBDToolkit Calibration Tutorial</a></li><li><a href=/blog/how-depth-sensor-works-in-5-minutes>How a Depth Sensor Works -
