But this is more about being responsive to changes you can't predict, and managing and encouraging that change with project stakeholders.</p><p>To the engineer in me, change is something to be managed effectively; to the artist, change and experimentation are vital, and at the forefront of my process. Given that my installations generally require custom software, I'm pleased to say the two approaches can be complimentary.</p><p><strong>Course changes</strong><br>I tend to characterise the open-ended process as a cascade, like in the image. (Not to be confused with the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model>Waterfall software design model</a>.)</p><p>In a cascade, when you begin at the top, you have no idea which point at the end of the journey you will end up. Several times on the journey you will hit forks, and will choose (or be forced to choose) new directions. As you travel, your idea may become more or less clear about where you are headed, but is still open to dramatic change.</p><p>When the outcome of a project was left open, you can look back across it and see lots of not-taken routes. These routes, although not present in the final work, played a very important role in leading to the final outcome. I won't say that they necessarily 'add layers' to the final work, but they do add layers to the journey which produced it, in whatever form it finally takes.</p><p><strong>Criticism</strong><br>How do you know when you've hit a fork, and which route to take?</p><p>It's hard to see something with fresh eyes when you are working on it every day, and you need fresh eyes to get a sense of the alignment between your intentions and what you have created.</p><p>This is where a trusted group of critics comes in. Other artists, friends, people at institutions and organisations you are related to - and genuine audiences, for example in <a href=//blog/installation-sketch-at-open-studios>open studios</a>.</p><p><strong>Crits at CAC</strong><br>The crits at <a href=//blog/residency-at-contemporary-artists-center>CAC</a> take the form of group studio visits. They are weekly, all resident artists take part, and they are timed to about 10-15 minutes per artist.</p><p>Each artist is invited to present his or her work, and to opt for just 'eyes and ears' or for a bounds-free, open ended discussion. The former is useful if you are at a certain stage of your process and aren't ready for a full crit yet, but most weeks many artists opt for the latter.</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-T-N03TB4xrU/UIFAdhxqQ7I/AAAAAAAABEs/1vAbeNGFL9M/s1600/P1070039.JPG style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img alt="Studios at CAC" height=667 width=500 src=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-T-N03TB4xrU/UIFAdhxqQ7I/AAAAAAAABEs/1vAbeNGFL9M/s667/P1070039.JPG></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Studios at CAC</td></tr></tbody></table><p>I found the most useful way to take advantage of this process was to set up a 'sketch' installation each week, representing the direction I was going at that moment (ready or not, mature or not). I would organise the space in a way similar to how I would present the work in a gallery, because installation is very experiential, and the <a href=http://jahyawords.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/working-with-total-space.html>space around the piece</a> is just as important.</p><p><strong>Not adding layers</strong><br>I would then let the group walk into the space in front of me, and then wait and not say anything. In any group, even shy ones, there are opinions bubbling under the surface and it doesn't make sense to pre-shape or pre-censor those opinions by 'framing' your work verbally.</p><p>I've heard that crits can be impassioned affairs, although I've never experienced this personally. Most artists seem to recognise that it is important in crits for the group to be able to talk openly and critically about the work they see.</p><p><strong>Points of change</strong><br>The cascading effect, aided by criticism, provides you as an artist with a approach in which you can explore openly - intellectually, visually, experientially and so on.</p><p>You can 'feel out' literally any direction, knowing that critical feedback will aid you. It may augment the direction by adding previously unconsidered layers. It may deaden the direction by pointing out potential flaws. It may highlight potential forks in the road, or it may confirm a direction by demonstrating that your critical audience is thinking about the subjects, questions and ideas you intended.</p><p>Each of these are valuable and allow you to bounce from one direction to another, and to zero in on a landing spot as you get closer to it.</p><p><strong>Criticism and Approval</strong><br>One final note - it's important to bear in mind that asking for criticism is not the same as asking for approval. Asking for approval leaves you in a weak position, and it is far better to ask for criticism and be supplied with a compliment than vice-versa.</p><p>By contrast, when asking for criticism you need to be prepared to accept that criticism on it's own terms. You may not agree with the criticism, but that doesn't mean it isn't valid. I find it helpful to try to understand the critique within the contextual framework from which it came. This often means asking questions back and trying to flesh out the context.</p><p>But, finally it will always be down to you which feedback to respond to, if at all. And ultimately it's an approach that helps you learn to trust your intuition.</p></div><a class=read-more href=/blog/the-cascading-process>Read more &gt;</a><hr class=separator></article><article role=article itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/BlogPosting><header><h1><a href=/blog/working-with-total-space>Working with Total Space</a></h1><div class=widgets>Posted on <time itemprop=dateCreated datetime=2012-10-09>Tuesday 9 October, 2012</time><ul class=social><li><a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=Working%20with%20Total%20Space&amp;url=http://jahya.net/blog/working-with-total-space&amp;via=hardwarehacklab"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Working%20with%20Total%20Space&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/working-with-total-space"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&amp;t=Working%20with%20Total%20Space&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/working-with-total-space"><i class="fa fa-tumblr-square"></i></a></li></ul></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Last night I cleared (almost) everything out of my studio - so that I could focus on the installation in terms of it's 'total space':</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Yu4RH1tT6Q8/UHO6C3lf58I/AAAAAAAABDE/Ld9GlaVmxYQ/s1600/cac-studio.JPG style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img alt="Studio 1 at CAC" height=694 width=500 src=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Yu4RH1tT6Q8/UHO6C3lf58I/AAAAAAAABDE/Ld9GlaVmxYQ/s694/cac-studio.JPG></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Rocks in Studio 1 at CAC</td></tr></tbody></table><p>By 'total space' I mean the space around the work, which viewers experience just as much as the work itself - in installations this space is part of the work and cannot be separated.</p><p>In this post I'll describe some of the dimensions I am considering when looking at this space, in the context of the work I'm currently developing.</p><p><strong>The original 'installations'</strong><br>Installation art got it's name because curators used to have to decide how to hang paintings and place sculptures. This was termed 'installation', and photographs for publication of several works together were called 'installation shots'.</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oiwT-sD2-JA/UHOebf8wcbI/AAAAAAAABBs/2aAa1x_Fslk/s1600/installation-shot.jpg style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img alt="An installation shot" height=332 width=500 src=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oiwT-sD2-JA/UHOebf8wcbI/AAAAAAAABBs/2aAa1x_Fslk/s500/installation-shot.jpg></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">An installation shot, at the Smithsonian<br>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/americanartmuseum/6322127606/">Smithsonian</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>For installation artists much, if not all, of that process of arrangement of objects in space has become an essential aspect of the artwork itself. Each work cannot exist in isolation but has to be considered in terms of it's relationship to the space in which it is installed.</p><p>So in practice, the work must be 'site-specific', or somehow transposable to more than one location.</p><p><strong>Using the architecture</strong><br>An interesting antecedent for 'transposable' work is Sol Lewitt. A few weeks ago at Mass MOCA I saw the work <a href="http://www.massmoca.org/lewitt/walldrawing.php?id=51">'Wall Drawing 51: All architectural points connected by straight lines'</a>.</p><p>As the title suggests, this work can be recreated in any location (as long as it has some architectural points).</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-D_WmXbiMAjw/UHPBQKuFIrI/AAAAAAAABDk/gqOdsu3C678/s1600/cac-sol.jpg imageanchor=1 style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img alt="Sol Lewitt" height=667 width=500 src=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-D_WmXbiMAjw/UHPBQKuFIrI/AAAAAAAABDk/gqOdsu3C678/s667/cac-sol.jpg></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Wall Drawing 51: All architectural points connected by straight lines<br>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brookems/">br_5530</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As with much of LeWitt's work, the art is in the crafting of sets of repeatable instructions. Those instructions can then be carried out again and again to produce physical instantiations of the work.</p><p>This is one way of making the work mutable, but it also carries a rigid inflexibility that constrains the piece and prevents it seeping beyond a defined boundary; the work cannot 'mutate' beyond the prescription of the instructions.</p><p>Much more common is the approach that the artist must be physically present to carry out or oversee the instantiation of the installation. The consideration then is how the work can mutate to converse with new surroundings in a way that compliments, augments or challenges it's origin.</p><p><strong>Navigating the space</strong><br>There are a number of transposable elements I am currently considering in how I present my work. Each will have to be reconsidered in each location it is installed, and it is worth noting a few of them here.</p><p>Firstly, what is the viewer's initial experience on entering the space?</p><p>Beyond that, what path(s) can viewers walk through to enter the space and approach the work? Which are more traveled, and why? What aspects of the work are accentuated by particular routes? Which routes encourage temporal or physical interaction with the piece, and which don't?</p><p>The routes viewers can take will have a big impact on how people respond to the installation. A 'throwaway comment' type of an installation might call for fast and casual footfall, but for my work which requires some time I am experimenting with ways of allowing passage through, while also creating a pool of space which is separate from the traffic, in which time can be spent and immersion can occur, without prescription that it <span style=font-style:italic>must</span> occur.</p><p><strong>Divisions within the space</strong><br>What distance do you want viewers to have from the work? Do you want people to walk through and explore, or is the work to be physically cut off, distant, or somehow different from the viewing space they occupy?</p><p>There is a work by Jospeh Beuys on permanent installation at Centre Pompidou in Paris, "Plight", which was very influential on me. One of the key aspects of the room, when we step back and stop thinking about the silence, the felt, and the presence of the room, is that <span style=font-style:italic>you can't enter the space</span>.</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jMj9WuHDDt8/UHN1Q8bBP0I/AAAAAAAABBM/IeMKk9d7UVw/s1600/plight.jpg style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img alt="Plight, Joseph Beuys" height=375 width=500 src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jMj9WuHDDt8/UHN1Q8bBP0I/AAAAAAAABBM/IeMKk9d7UVw/s500/plight.jpg></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Plight, Joseph Beuys<br>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gastev/359769579/">Gastev</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>A rail prevents your entry, and also delineates a small viewing platform. This gives the space a sense of otherness, and timelessness. In this context, the rail is part of what gives the installation it's gravity, it's immanence, it's sense of potential.</p><p><strong>The frame</strong><br>And for all the talk about the democratization of space, about how installation takes away the centred viewer, there is always still a frame within which your work will be considered.</p><p>This might be an institutional frame, and therefore conceptual. But even physically, there is a frame provided by the walls, by markings on the floor, by the use of light, by ropes, gates or rails. And if there isn't a frame already, you have the option of introducing one. As in "Plight" this frame can serve as a boundary, or the frame can be just a suggestion.</p><p>In many room-sized installations there is no physical frame - this means that the work is fully immersive and is a deliberate move on the artist's part to obscure the frame so that viewers are not aware it. In these cases the work can still be framed by the physical features of the room, and particularly by the transitional nature of the entranceway provided to enter the space.</p><p>In any case, the concept of a frame is something which you can work with or against.</p><p><strong>Emphasis and de-emphasis</strong><br>What elements of the space are the ones that viewers <span style=font-style:italics>can't</span> see?</p><p>In the work I am creating at the moment, I want to draw back the sense that technology is central in the work. So I am experimenting with techniques for placing the projector I am using to craft the light out of view. This is not to attempt to obscure the fact that a projector is the medium by whch the light is being crafted, but rather to de-emphasise the role the projector plays and emphasise instead the light on it's own terms.</p><p><strong>Indoor not outdoor</strong><br>Since arriving here at CAC I have been increasingly focused on the installation potential for this project rather than outdoor. It's odd, because <a href=//blog/portable-projection-in-rural-context>the project began with</a> such an outdoor focus.</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qowJ026ch1Q/UHOrVNanYTI/AAAAAAAABCk/CJDvoHtBygw/s1600/land3.JPG style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img alt="Outdoor shot at I-Park" height=667 width=500 src=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qowJ026ch1Q/UHOrVNanYTI/AAAAAAAABCk/CJDvoHtBygw/s667/land3.JPG></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Outdoor shot at I-Park</td></tr></tbody></table><p>There were a whole set of issues related to working outdoors; technology, projectors, and sound equipment, and it was forcing me down a road of 'one-off' performances or interventions. Those elements are not crucial for this particular work at it's current stage, and so they have been sidelined.</p><p>There is still strong outdoor potential for this work, more so than my previous projects. However at this stage, quickfire experimentation took priority, and indoor rocks became both a pragmatic reality and a potent ground for exploration.</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-75u9oe--jRc/UHOo0s9OB1I/AAAAAAAABCY/dxWaPOXHEH4/s1600/land2.JPG style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img alt="The gear" height=200 width=266 src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-75u9oe--jRc/UHOo0s9OB1I/AAAAAAAABCY/dxWaPOXHEH4/s266/land2.JPG></a> <a href=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PGyTGjZlRHM/UHOoRZmOxdI/AAAAAAAABCM/czZCZOqwKz0/s1600/land.JPG style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img alt="The handtruck" height=200 width=150 src=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PGyTGjZlRHM/UHOoRZmOxdI/AAAAAAAABCM/czZCZOqwKz0/s200/land.JPG></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Packing up gear to take on the land at I-Park</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The conceptual grounding which was so engaging at the start, could be brought indoors and more easily experimented with.

What this means is that when we look, hear and otherwise sense the world around us, the combined sensation we experience is not a mirror-like reflection of reality, but an ongoing, constructed, internal model.</p><p>It's not a new idea, in fact it has been the essential paradigm since <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant>Kant</a>'s so-called 'Copernican Revolution'. But I believe these ideas are intellectually and culturally crucial in an age of overpopulation, multiculturalism and burgeoning globalisation; in which value system clashes are increasingly common.</p><p>I think that highlighting the powerful creative process of our individual perception can have an empowering effect, as it places us in the driving seat. First, I want to expand on this idea, and then I want to discuss how it is influencing my work.</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: right"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: right"><a href=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-16yAeO8Ax3M/UEWtACLBf5I/AAAAAAAAA-o/tREhcZg0dnY/s1600/P1060702.JPG><img alt="Objects surfaces coated with light (detail)" height=375 width=500 src=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-16yAeO8Ax3M/UEWtACLBf5I/AAAAAAAAA-o/tREhcZg0dnY/s500/P1060702.JPG></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Objects surfaces coated with light (detail)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>I've always been fascinated by the textures of rocks, stones, bricks and other repeated but unpredictable surfaces. There is so much differentiation across the surface of a rock, so many peaks and troughs, that it is impossible to focus on and remember the intricate detail of even one small section at a time.</p><p>On one end of the scale, we know from school that a grain of sand contains billions of billions (of billions) of atoms. And that each atom is enormous compared to the tiny particles it in turn is made of.</p><p>And at the other end of the scale, we know that the universe is so large that the extent of it we can even see is determined by the time it took the light to travel - billions of years - and that it goes on beyond that in all directions.</p><p>There is so much going on around us every moment, and we are permanently and fundamentally incapable of noting, perceiving, processing all this complexity. Instead we live our whole lives working only with generalisations: abstractions, metaphors, categories, narratives, histories, empirical models and so on.</p><p>And we are built to take much of these abstractions at face value, as though they inhere in the fabric of reality itself. It's a process which is fundamental to conscious life - it would be impossible to live (or to ever make a decision) without being able to do it.</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: right"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: right"><a href=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mot5-I-0wb8/UEWrxFz41PI/AAAAAAAAA-c/6F3Tbtvrteg/s1600/P1060691.JPG><img alt="Object surfaces coated with light" height=375 width=500 src=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mot5-I-0wb8/UEWrxFz41PI/AAAAAAAAA-c/6F3Tbtvrteg/s500/P1060691.JPG></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Object surfaces coated with light</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Some of these abstractions - cultural differences, language and so on, are learned. Going deeper, many of the more fundamental abstractions are built into our perceptual apparatus, because they are essential to both our perceptual process, and are essential aspects of the things being perceived.</p><p>We've all seen the optical illusions that demonstrate perceptual flaws. But optical illusions don't just demonstrate holes in an otherwise flawless perceptual process - they demonstrate the constructive way in which our entire experience is presented to us as reality.</p><p>For example, our eyes contain lenses, like those in a camera, which focus light onto a retina. A retina is a patch of light-sensitive tissue much like film. Like cameras, eyes are only capable of producing 2D images. The 3D world we experience is an internal mental construction, created by triangulating the positions of objects based on images from both eyes.</p><p>There may be a 3D world out there in front of us, but the 3D world we experience in our minds is a construction. It's a construction which enables us to navigate the 3D world it represents, but it's a construction nonetheless.</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: right"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: right"><a href=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-R8ylso93N8o/UEWqf-kKCUI/AAAAAAAAA-Q/UMvmsxrIvlk/s1600/P1060728.JPG><img alt="Grid to mask around object surfaces to be 'painted' with light" height=375 width=500 src=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-R8ylso93N8o/UEWqf-kKCUI/AAAAAAAAA-Q/UMvmsxrIvlk/s500/P1060728.JPG></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Grid to mask around object surfaces to be 'painted' with light</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A couple more examples. Colour is just the brain's way of representing different wavelengths of light (i.e. wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation from the sun). Each surface in front of us reflects a particular wavelength based on it's pigmentation, and our visual system assigns that wavelength an appropriate colour to help us navigate and respond appropriately to the things around us.</p><p>Our ears only sense changes in air pressure, but if someone is bouncing a ball behind you, you have an innate sense of the position. Your brain is combining data <span style=font-style:italic>across the senses</span>: performing complex sound frequency analysis and comparisons from both ear drums, borrowing from your memory of the scene the last time you looked in that direction, and continually updating the constructed model of reality you perceive.</p><p>And it only gets more complicated from there - add to this the intricacies of spoken language, facial cues, body language, taste, smell, hunger, fear, emotion, instinctive or learned over a lifetime, and automatically embedded into our perceptual process. We have the ability to override parts of this model, to reason our way past it and so on. But the model is a construction, and a large web of associations - some native to our DNA, the rest built from previous experience - determine how we currently experience it.</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: right"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: right"><a href=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HbZSnKvQzPg/UERRjTfsE1I/AAAAAAAAA8w/t8nUGm5GtJo/s1600/P1060605.JPG><img alt="Objects gathered in the studio" height=375 width=500 src=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HbZSnKvQzPg/UERRjTfsE1I/AAAAAAAAA8w/t8nUGm5GtJo/s500/P1060605.JPG></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Objects gathered in the studio</td></tr></tbody></table><p>How much of what we perceive in an object inheres in the object itself? And what happens when we are presented with genuinely new experiences?</p><p>Various art movements have attempted to heighten people's bodily awareness, of their creative perception in action, inspired by <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Merleau-Ponty>Merleau-Ponty</a>, minimalism and embodied viewing.</p><p>But what I'm interested in doing is not so much to increase the awareness of embodied space, but instead to reduce the foothold of the nexus of previous associations. To force new associations to be quickly constructed to account for the new phenomena.</p><p>Each time we travel to a new place, meet somebody new or different, this process of disorientation and new construction can occur. But when it happens in life, it's often muddied by the hustle and bustle of daily social reality, and of preconceived associations. I'm interested in creating spaces where this process can happen in relative isolation, so that the phenomenon on display can be appreciated on it's own terms.</p><p>To do this, I am experimenting with a technique of projected audio and video, with the two synthetically intertwined. I believe this approach can work to achieve these ends for a number of reasons.</p><p>Firstly, projection means low-light. As a viewer, the enveloping void of space around created in a night sky reduces the efficacy of the 3D-triangulation apparatus in your brain, offering you less certainty in the internal world you create. It offers less connection to specific other objects, and creates a space where the brightly-lit video is the focal point.</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: right"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: right"><a href=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-e-5fvnuhxQM/UERCGZaOIKI/AAAAAAAAA8A/-p7fLAGqy5c/s1600/P1060083.JPG><img alt="Objects in the I-Park graveyard" height=375 width=500 src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-e-5fvnuhxQM/UERCGZaOIKI/AAAAAAAAA8A/-p7fLAGqy5c/s500/P1060083.JPG></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Objects in <a href=//blog/the-i-park-graveyard>the I-Park graveyard</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Secondly, advances in computer technology in the last several years have made it possible to intertwine sound and light patterns in a way that is genuinely new. This provides a space for exploration where new multi-sensory spatial patterns can be created, reducing the baggage of learned preconception. The key mistake to avoid here is over-stimulation - it is best to avoid a sense of a 'light show', as that has a specific set of built-in associations.</p><p>Thirdly, the projection-mapping technique allows textures, light patterns, colours and so on to be 'warped' around objects, so that the objects are 'reskinned'. Again, the pitfall to avoid here is making the resulting light patterns too 'neat' or configured in a way which confirms or reminds of existing associations.</p><p>The space is 'alien', but it is not empty.</p><p>The space can be fully alive, but it takes the isolation and presentation as 'alien' to make such alien spaces live. The idea is to reduce the foothold of existing associations, but also to present a new space for exploration. In a space like this we can make a leap from that alien space, and try to find a connection in it - to find value from valuelessness.</p></div><a class=read-more href=/blog/perception-as-creative-process>Read more &gt;</a><hr class=separator></article><ul id=paging class=cta><li><a href="/blog/page4/">&lt; Previous page</a></li><li><a href="/blog/page6/">Next page &gt;</a></li></ul></main><aside class=right><nav><header><h1>All posts</h1></header><h2 id=2015-ref>2015</h2><ul><li><a href=/blog/new-site-for-hardware-hack-lab>New Site for Hardware Hack Lab</a></li></ul><h2 id=2014-ref>2014</h2><ul><li><a href=/blog/sound-control-at-future-interfaces>Sound Control at Future Interfaces</a></li><li><a href=/blog/projection-masking-not-projection>Projection Masking, not Projection Mapping</a></li><li><a href=/blog/addon-for-openframeworks-kinect-v2-and>Addon for openFrameworks, Kinect V2 and Mac</a></li><li><a href=/blog/john-cleese-on-creativity>John Cleese on Creativity</a></li><li><a href=/blog/takeaways-from-eyeo-2014>Takeaways from Eyeo 2014</a></li><li><a href=/blog/hardware-hacker-culture-of-new-york>Hardware Hacker Culture of New York</a></li><li><a href=/blog/future-visions-for-human-interaction>Future Visions for Human Interaction</a></li><li><a href=/blog/openbci-nears-its-kickstarter-goal>OpenBCI Nears it's Kickstarter Goal</a></li></ul><h2 id=2013-ref>2013</h2><ul><li><a href=/blog/sound-chamber-2013>Sound Chamber (2013)</a></li><li><a href=/blog/openbci-hackathon-at-thoughtworks>OpenBCI Hackathon at ThoughtWorks</a></li><li><a href=/blog/exploring-depth-video-at-culturehub>Exploring Depth Video at CultureHub</a></li><li><a href=/blog/introduction-to-ibeacons>Introduction to iBeacons</a></li><li><a href=/blog/volumetric-lab-at-culturehub-nyc>Volumetric Lab at CultureHub NYC</a></li><li><a href=/blog/randomness-in-algorithm>Randomness in the Algorithm</a></li><li><a href=/blog/study-existential>Video: Existential</a></li><li><a href=/blog/the-visual-art-of-brian-eno>The Visual Art of Brian Eno</a></li><li><a href=/blog/rgbdtoolkit-sketch-at-sampler>RGBDToolkit Sketch at The Sampler</a></li><li><a href=/blog/the-artist-geek-hybrid>The Artist-Geek Hybrid</a></li><li><a href=/blog/rgbdtoolkit-calibration-tutorial>RGBDToolkit Calibration Tutorial</a></li><li><a href=/blog/how-depth-sensor-works-in-5-minutes>How a Depth Sensor Works -
