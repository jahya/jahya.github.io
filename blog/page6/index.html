With Mason's help I have numbered the areas where rocks are lying together (the numbering is mine, these areas are not on any maps at I-Park).</p><p>I include a few more shots below, but first of all, how we got there. Walking the trails is fine for a leisurely Sunday afternoon, but if you're working the grounds you need to get about quickly.

Mason is out on this thing all the time. Nice job.</p><p>In each area where we found rocks there were often several clumped together. In Area #3, they were quite spaced apart. This rock is in the same vicinity as the one at the top of this post:</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: right"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: right"><a href=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MMfh-C73wEg/UEPJBqIapaI/AAAAAAAAA5Q/4A_QzLyCc_Q/s1600/ipark-rock-3d.JPG><img alt="A nearby rock in Area #3" height=667 width=500 src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MMfh-C73wEg/UEPJBqIapaI/AAAAAAAAA5Q/4A_QzLyCc_Q/s667/ipark-rock-3d.JPG></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">A nearby rock in Area #3</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Some of the rocks are collected together in such a way that the layout almost looks 'designed'.</p><p>For example, the rocks in Area #5 are lined up together so that they look like a kind of entrance-way, with a rock precariously balanced at the top to make cubby-hole:</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: right"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: right"><a href=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--H3PKI-dAFk/UEPJPQOttaI/AAAAAAAAA5c/eT90OAojK2s/s1600/ipark-rock-5a.JPG><img alt="Rocks in Area #5" height=375 width=500 src=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--H3PKI-dAFk/UEPJPQOttaI/AAAAAAAAA5c/eT90OAojK2s/s500/ipark-rock-5a.JPG></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Rocks in Area #5</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Whether or not these rocks were moved here, it does remind me of one of the recurring themes on this trip. I am told that this land was once intensively cultivated, not so long ago. This forest is second / third growth, a number which refers to the times it has been razed down for farmland and left to grow again.</p><p>Connecticut is part of New England, and this area is full of second-growth forest. Settlers from Europe farmed here until eventually much more fertile, flat and spacious land was settled in the Mid-West. The land here was eventually abandoned for the more profitable property West of here.</p><p>It's hard to believe when people tell you that - but the evidence is right here in front of us:</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: right"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: right"><a href=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6P-CSq2SUX4/UEPcyj65umI/AAAAAAAAA6g/uydSUItEmP4/s1600/Model_A_Ford-1024x613.jpg><img alt="A Model A Ford" height=287 width=480 src=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6P-CSq2SUX4/UEPcyj65umI/AAAAAAAAA6g/uydSUItEmP4/s480/Model_A_Ford-1024x613.jpg></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">A Model A Ford - photo by <a href="http://www.filmandscissors.com/">Tess Martin</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>It's a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_A_%281927%E2%80%931931%29>Model A Ford</a>, in the middle of the I-Park forest.

I intend to use a cart to wheel the battery around but it's important to bear in mind that I will be walking along trails at I-Park, not flat paths. I will also be carrying a projector, laptop, sound system, camera, and probably other bits &amp; pieces too.</p><p>The 75Ah battery is 60 pounds, and the 92Ah is 75 pounds. It's hard to know upfront just how much of a problem this will be, but I opted for the easier-to-carry option.</p><p><strong>The inverter</strong><br>I calculated that I would have an operating power consumption of 320-330W, based on a projector of <a href=http://www.projectorcentral.com/Optoma-EX525ST.htm>280</a> or <a href=http://www.projectorcentral.com/Panasonic-PT-AX200U.htm>290W</a> (depending on which projector I actually use), and a small sound system of 40W.

The MacBook Pro battery life will be reduced quite a bit anyway because of high CPU load associated with intensive media processing. On the other hand, the battery life could be longer because the screen will be off during performance (the projector will handle all the visual output).</p><p>However, in the worst-case scenario, if I decide during testing that I need to power the MacBook Pro from the lead-acid battery, I can just switch to an <a href=http://www.mcmelectronics.com/product/72-9695>800W inverter</a>.</p><p>The other problem is that it is said that <a href=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OLBqmBiEp00/UBAQIEcTxHI/AAAAAAAAA0I/xV257qtbGHg/s1600/waveform.gif>modified sine wave</a> inverters (as opposed to 'pure sine wave' inverters), while cheaper, <a href=http://www.ehow.com/info_10002278_problems-modified-sine-wave-inverters.html>can cause a loud hum</a>.

Firstly, they are each rated to charge a battery with up-to a certain number of Amp-hours. So the inverter I chose had to support a battery of 75Ah.</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><a href=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qyJdWPkJdRw/T_42zzdASBI/AAAAAAAAAzY/DPl19E0xfnY/s1600/iparkCharger.jpg style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img alt="CTEK MULTI US 3300 De-Sulfating Charger" height=200 width=200 src=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qyJdWPkJdRw/T_42zzdASBI/AAAAAAAAAzY/DPl19E0xfnY/s200/iparkCharger.jpg></a></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">CTEK MULTI US 3300 De-Sulfating Charger</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Secondly, there is the charging speed. Andrew Crowe points out:</p><blockquote>"3.3A charging current isn't great, that'll take a very long time to charge ... I'd look for one with at least 4A max charging."</blockquote><p>The problem here is that I couldn't source a charger that supported both a 75Ah battery and a 4A charging current... at least not without opting for an industrial solution way beyond the scope of this project.</p><p>So my charger supports 75Ah battery with a 3.3A charging current. Extrapolating from figures Andrew supplied me from his experiences with smaller batteries, I estimate that it might take 20-24 hours to charge.</p><p>This is a restriction. Sunset will be around 7pm in August in Connecticut. Since I can only use the projector at night, I might like to go out at 8pm each evening and return at 11-12pm. If it takes 24 hours to charge, I will not be able to keep that rhythm and it may impose a 48 hour gap in between performances.</p><p>However, if the battery isn't fully charged, I could still go out with a 75% charged battery. And in practice the battery may take 20 hours to charge.</p><p>Ideally I would have a 100% charged battery ready to use at 8pm each evening, but we'll see how the tests pan out. It may be that I have to find a better charging solution, or work within the restrictions.</p><p>It's also a very fair point to say that this artificial restriction could be useful - it imposes a 'day off' from performances for reflecting, documenting and making changes to the performance in preparation for the following night.</p></div><a class=read-more href=/blog/the-shopping-list-for-projection-bombing>Read more &gt;</a><hr class=separator></article><article role=article itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/BlogPosting><header><h1><a href=/blog/portable-projection-in-rural-context>Portable Projection in a Rural Context</a></h1><div class=widgets>Posted on <time itemprop=dateCreated datetime=2012-07-13>Friday 13 July, 2012</time><ul class=social><li><a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=Portable%20Projection%20in%20a%20Rural%20Context&amp;url=http://jahya.net/blog/portable-projection-in-rural-context&amp;via=hardwarehacklab"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Portable%20Projection%20in%20a%20Rural%20Context&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/portable-projection-in-rural-context"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&amp;t=Portable%20Projection%20in%20a%20Rural%20Context&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/portable-projection-in-rural-context"><i class="fa fa-tumblr-square"></i></a></li></ul></div></header><div class=post-content><p>In just over a month I will start a <a href=//blog/i-park-residency>one-month residency at I-Park</a>. My proposal is based around 'portable projection', and in this post I want to describe what that means and what I am planning to do onsite.</p><p>My proposal to I-Park was that I will appropriate the projection bombing technique (described below), but this time to explore a new approach to my installation work. Instead of scanning, photographing, replicating or manufacturing textures in a studio or gallery, I wanted to work with real, physical objects and textures, which have a life - and unpredictability - of their own.</p><p>My proposal is to explore the surfaces and textures of the woodland, by writing software patches which generate 2D geometric shapes, and projecting them as moving video sequences.</p><p>The flat plane of the 2D geometric shapes (projected on the flat plane of the 2D projection surface) will be distorted by the underlying natural textures and shapes that the light falls on. In this way, the underlying material will drive the visual artifact in a very direct and immediately perceptible way.</p><p><strong>Projection Bombing</strong><br>When people talk about portable projection they often mean <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handheld_projector>Pico Projectors</a>: very small hand-held projectors with built-in batteries. However these projectors (by nature) are not powerful enough to provide an effective image for bright, realistic video.</p><p>The terms 'mobile projection', 'portable projection' and 'projection bombing' therefore also refer to a separate, established technique - that of making a regular, mains-powered video projector portable, by attaching it temporarily to a car battery:</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><div style="text-align: center"><iframe frameborder=0 height=281 width=500 src=http://www.youtube.com/embed/JxFhSgasFDw></iframe></div></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Example of 'guerrilla' projection bombing, Rio de Janeiro, 2007</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This approach removes the restriction of position, where a projector can only usually be moved a few meters, or the distance of a power cord. Instead, you need to carry, wheel or drive a car battery around with you to keep the projector powered.</p><p><strong>New restrictions</strong><br>However, with this approach you gain new restrictions. Moving a heavy car battery can be cumbersome, and you can only power the projector this way for a period of 1-2 hours before you need to recharge the car battery - which takes several hours.</p><p>The technique is usually associated with a small <a href="http://www.graffitiresearchlab.com/blog/projects/interactive-architecture/">creative subculture</a> of VJs, street artists and media programmers. It often takes place in an urban context, and has a 'guerrilla' feel - the targeted building surfaces, and projected imagery are often chosen 'on the night', and / or the building owners aren't consulted beforehand.</p><p>As with all new techniques ofcourse, media companies have appropriated it to create promotional stunts for their clients. (Compare an <a href=http://www.gravitytrap.com/artwork/wildlife>original</a>, in 2006 by <a href="http://www.gravitytrap.com/">Karolina Sobecka</a>, with an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLjdbemGNuU">ad agency version</a> from 2012 inspired by the original).</p><p><strong>Textures and surfaces - why projection-bomb in a rural context?</strong><br>In my previous installation work, I have explored revelation of textural detail:</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><div style="text-align: center"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/24999373?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width=500 height=281 frameborder=0></iframe></div></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center"><a href=//blog/gravity-2011>Gravity</a>, 2011</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 'Gravity', 2011, I was experimenting with the idea of the 'endless plane' which extends beyond the canvass borders. Paintings have long explored this idea, and I was particularly influenced the work of Mark Rothko or Jackson Pollock. Using software and projectors I have been experimenting with the idea that the plane can be slowly revealed, one frame at a time.</p><p>Rather than manufacturing a frame, I will be working with found forms and textures on the grounds of I-Park, and temporarily altering the way they are perceived by projecting combined sound and light.</p><p><strong>The grounds at I-Park</strong><br>I-Park is located in a remote, 450-acre woodland with "ponds, hills, streams, stone outcroppings and sheer cliffs" and "wild fields and new growth forest, as well as miles of stonewalls and walking trails".

From Sanborn's <a href="http://jimsanborn.net/">portfolio</a>:</p><blockquote>"These images were produced by direct, large format, light projection. The projector, powered by a mobile generator, was moved from site to site. All of the pieces were photographed at night using long exposures. On moonless nights, the landscape was lit with searchlights. The landforms themselves are quite large, requiring the projector and camera to be, on average, 1/2 mile away from the subject landscape."</blockquote><p>Looking at Sanborn's work makes clear a few important questions that I have to consider.</p><p><strong>1. The decentred viewer?</strong><br>Firstly, due to the remote locations, audiences will rarely directly perceive the work. Dissemination relies heavily on documentation, and therefore documentation takes on an importance equal to that of the artwork itself.</p><p>This is troubling for an installation artist. Mainly this is because by providing a 'frame' from which to view your work, i.e. a photographic or video frame, you are taking away all other possible perspectives of your work. You are eliminating the 'decentered viewer' <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Installation-Art-Claire-Bishop/dp/0415974127>as described by Claire Bishop</a>, and you are putting a nail in the coffin of viewer participation too.</p><p>However the way I am choosing to look at this is that it is a sequence of short intervention experiments. The end result it may lead to is unknown to me. This may become a performance, it may lead to other directions for installations, or it may be the last portable work that I create. It's hard to say, but that's the nature of experimentation.</p><p><strong>2. Differentiation</strong><br>Since Sanborn's work is aesthetically so similar to that which I am hoping to achieve, it becomes an interesting point of departure. It forces questions about what is the essential nature of my proposal, and the question: What is it that I hope to achieve beyond or seperate from what Sanborn has already achieved?</p><p>The first thing to note is that Jim Sanborn's work is beautiful. It is also large-scale, well-funded, and very carefully considered work. What I am planning for I-Park is very ad-hoc and small-scale by comparison.</p><p>But putting that aside, there are also conceptual differences. These differences have a lot to do with the influence of digital culture in 2012. But on closer inspection they are also centred around intention, presentation, appearance and dissemination.</p><p><strong>Generative sound &amp; video</strong><br>I will be working with a laptop and a projector. The laptop will run software which will produce video and sound simultaneously. The software will produce those media 'on the fly', which means that unlike Sanborn's work mine will be 'generative' and changeable (and as such, bears the relevant nods to John Cage, Brian Eno, Sol LeWitt, and many others.)</p><p>The sound and video will be created together and, ideally, will exist as a single entity. Data from the one will feed the other, as in the work of Memo Akten:</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><div style="text-align: center"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/28239261?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width=500 height=75 frameborder=0></iframe></div></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Simple Harmonic Motion study #5d by Memo Akten</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Where Akten's work is purely pattern-based, I will introduce a certain amount of randomness. This is very much intentional. Each evening I want to go out and perform a short (1-2hr) experiment, allowing patterns to generate and run.</p><p>The next day I want to try a new pattern, software patch or set of geometries, influenced by the previous evening's work, but never fully take control. There is a fast turnaround and each installation will be fleeting, but each installation will also be surprising, since it will not be defined upfront.</p><p><strong>Borders &amp; masking</strong><br>Where Sanborn allows the natural borders of his patterns to be exposed, I intend to 'mask' my projections in the 'projection mapping' style:</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><div style="text-align: center"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/3156857?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width=400 height=250 frameborder=0></iframe></div></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center">Projections mapped over vines</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The main reason for this is that Sanborn used either moonlight, or search lights to expose the non-projected areas. This makes sense with long-exposure photographs but moonlight will not make a difference to video. This is potentially an area to be explored.</p><p>Another difference which may exist (I will find out when I do it) is that my work may expose a little more of the technological mechanisms which produce it. This isn't necessarily by design, but with a lower budget and a car battery rather than a generator, the projector used at certain angles may show pixels, or differences in brightness over extended distances, or other artifacts that I haven't thought of yet. This isn't my intention, but it will be interesting to see what effect this might have.</p><p><strong>The purpose of documentation</strong><br>In Sanborn's work, the time dimension is noticable. The long exposures mean that stars in the night sky are captured moving from position to position, which gives a subtle but powerful sense that these are not just 'recordings' of events, but are events mixed with recording techniques.</p><p>It's hard to see where the recorded event ends and the recording technique begins. They are fully intertwined, since the represented event in the documented image was never really experienced by a human in quite the way it is presented.</p><p>With my work at I-Park, the recorded documentation will be in video form. The role of the video will be to demonstrate the installation as recorded from a particular angle, as faithfully as possible. The primary focus of my work will be the live event, and the video recording will be an attempt only to reproduce that event for dissemination, not to become part of the work as such in itself.</p><p>However although that's the intention, inevitably the recorded events will become a lens through which the work is viewed, and therefore can't fail to have a big impact on it's perception. But as discussed above the future of the work is open-ended - it was concieved as installation and as a work for direct perception by audiences, but the emphasis may change depending on the results.</p><p><strong>Dissemination</strong><br>I want to publish the work online as I go, week by week. This means I have the potential to get external feedback as the process develops, rather than after delivering the work at the end in a gallery or presentational setting. I'm viewing this residency as an open-ended experiment.</p><p>With that in mind, it makes sense to try to initiate a group of interested individuals before I start, designers, software developers, artists, who might be interested in commenting on the experiments.</p><p>I'm looking forward to starting the experiments, and will be posting more info about the preparation work I'm doing over the coming weeks.</p></div><a class=read-more href=/blog/portable-projection-in-rural-context>Read more &gt;</a><hr class=separator></article><article role=article itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/BlogPosting><header><h1><a href=/blog/stephen-lumentas-sc-textmate-bundle>Stephen Lumenta's SC TextMate Bundle</a></h1><div class=widgets>Posted on <time itemprop=dateCreated datetime=2012-06-20>Wednesday 20 June, 2012</time><ul class=social><li><a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=Stephen%20Lumenta's%20SC%20TextMate%20Bundle&amp;url=http://jahya.net/blog/stephen-lumentas-sc-textmate-bundle&amp;via=hardwarehacklab"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Stephen%20Lumenta's%20SC%20TextMate%20Bundle&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/stephen-lumentas-sc-textmate-bundle"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></a></li><li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&amp;t=Stephen%20Lumenta's%20SC%20TextMate%20Bundle&amp;u=http://jahya.net/blog/stephen-lumentas-sc-textmate-bundle"><i class="fa fa-tumblr-square"></i></a></li></ul></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Some of the keyboard combinations I was <a href=//blog/setting-up-supercollider-with-textmate>using in my TextMate / SC bundle</a> weren't working, so <a href=http://new-supercollider-mailing-lists-forums-use-these.2681727.n2.nabble.com/TextMate-supercollider-tmbundle-td4462189.html>on the advice of users in the forum</a> I decided to switch to <a href=https://github.com/sbl/scmate.tmbundle>a new fork</a>.</p><p>Stephen Lumenta's fork is much more up-to-date, appears to be being actively supported, and has a number of <a href=http://new-supercollider-mailing-lists-forums-use-these.2681727.n2.nabble.com/scmate-textmate-bundle-td5239359.html>improvements to the master</a>.</p><table class=tr-caption-container style="float:right; text-align: center; margin-left: 2em"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center"><img alt="TextMate logo" height=200 width=200 src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-T4SJ275Hwws/T8_blhcWRsI/AAAAAAAAAvE/zS9pNMuTb8U/s200/textmate.png style="float:right; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em"></td></tr><tr><td class=tr-caption style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: small; text-align: left">More TextMate setup</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>It worked in the end, but I thought I'd post a few pointers to anyone else trying set this up or use it:</p><p><strong>Setup issues: select the right branch</strong><br>If you are using SC &gt;= 3.5, make sure you use the <a href=https://github.com/sbl/scmate.tmbundle/tree/qt_35>qt_35 branch</a>. That means switching the top-left corner and then clicking the zip download link. As of this writing all the <code>git clone</code> commands point to the &lt; 3.5 version.</p><p>When you have downloaded the file and unzipped it, you can rename it to <code>scmate.tmbundle</code> and place it in the TextMate bundles directory so that it matches how it would have looked if you'd cloned it:</p><p class=code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/scmate.tmbundle</code></p><p>(Where the tilde ~ represents your User's home directory)</p><p><strong>Setup issues: Use the default SC directory</strong><br>Make sure SuperCollider is installed in the default app location. I had SC installed inside a subdirectory, and although (as the <a href=https://github.com/sbl/scmate.tmbundle/tree/qt_35>readme</a> suggests) you can fiddle with paths it's just easier to use the default location:</p><p class=code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;~/Applications/SuperCollider.app</code></p><p><strong>Complete the installation</strong><br>Remember to complete the installation by launching TextMate and selecting this menu option:</p><p class=code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bundles &gt; SuperCollider &gt; SCLang &gt; Complete Installation</code></p><p>This command copies some <code>.sc</code> linkage files into a SuperCollider startup precompilation directory. When you next start SC, it should find and parse these files, and include the results in the SC runtime.</p><p><strong>Usage</strong><br>To actually use the bundle:</p><ol><li>If you haven't already done so, launch SC and complete the installation</li><li>Create a new TextMate window and select SuperCollider from the drop-down at the bottom</li><li>Select the following menu item, or use <code>Cmd-F1</code> (you may have to actually press <code>Cmd-Fn-F1</code>):<br></li></ol><p class=code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bundles &gt; SuperCollider &gt; Launch SCLang</code></p><p>You should see a Terminal window pop up and show you the usual SC startup script. You should also notice <code>sclang</code> starting up as a program in your app menu, called from the Terminal.</p><p>With this bundle, all your communication will be with the Terminal rather than the SC post window. If (like me) you like the internal / localhost GUIs, you can launch those via code:</p><p class=code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;Server.local.makeGui;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Server.internal.makeGui;</code></p><p>They will respond in the usual way.</p><ol start=4><li>Type and execute a few commands in TextMate to make sure everything is working (keyboard commands at the bottom of this post):<ul><li><code>s.boot;</code></li><li><code>"test".postln;</code></li><li><code>{SinOsc.ar}.play;</code></li></ul></li></ol><p>At this point, you are good to go.</p><p><strong>A clean exit</strong><br>To cleanly exit <code>sclang</code>, use <code>Ctrl-C</code> in the Terminal window. This will kill the <code>sclang</code> process and you should notice the <code>sclang</code> app icon disappear from your app menu.</p><p>If you forget to kill <code>sclang</code> in this way, the next time you try to launch SC from TextMate it will tell you there is already an <code>sclang</code> process. To kill that process, just quit <code>sclang</code> from the app menu, and then remove the temp files via the Terminal:</p><p class=code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;rm /tmp/sclang*</code></p><p>You should then be able to boot <code>sclang</code> from the <code>Bundles</code> menu as usual.</p><p><strong>Terminal choice</strong><br>If you want to use a Terminal other than the default one, you will need to make an edit to this file:</p><p class=code><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;/scmate.tmbundle/Commands/Launch SCLang.tmCommand</code><br></p><p>You can change the referenced <code>.app</code> package to be your favourite terminal app.</p><p><strong>Common shortcuts</strong><br>The bundle shortcut keys can be accessed via the TextMate <code>Bundles</code> menu, but here are a few basic ones to get you going - mixed with some useful TextMate shortcuts for use with SC:</p><table class=displaytable><tr><td><code>Shift-Cmd-B</code></td><td>Select everything within the enclosing brackets / braces</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 120px"><code>Shift-Enter</code></td><td>Evaluate</td></tr><tr><td><code>Ctrl-.</code></td><td>Stop all playback</td></tr><tr><td><code>Cmd-D</code></td><td>Open help for item at text cursor (no need to fully highlight)</td></tr><tr><td><code>Cmd-J</code></td><td>Open source code for item at text cursor</td></tr><tr><td><code>Ctrl-Shift-D</code></td><td>Duplicate</td></tr><tr><td><code>Cmd-[ and Cmd-]</code></td><td>Indent left / right (select code block first)</td></tr></table></div><a class=read-more href=/blog/stephen-lumentas-sc-textmate-bundle>Read more &gt;</a><hr class=separator></article><ul id=paging class=cta><li><a href="/blog/page5/">&lt; Previous page</a></li><li><a href="/blog/page7/">Next page &gt;</a></li></ul></main><aside class=right><nav><header><h1>All posts</h1></header><h2 id=2015-ref>2015</h2><ul><li><a href=/blog/new-site-for-hardware-hack-lab>New Site for Hardware Hack Lab</a></li></ul><h2 id=2014-ref>2014</h2><ul><li><a href=/blog/sound-control-at-future-interfaces>Sound Control at Future Interfaces</a></li><li><a href=/blog/projection-masking-not-projection>Projection Masking, not Projection Mapping</a></li><li><a href=/blog/addon-for-openframeworks-kinect-v2-and>Addon for openFrameworks, Kinect V2 and Mac</a></li><li><a href=/blog/john-cleese-on-creativity>John Cleese on Creativity</a></li><li><a href=/blog/takeaways-from-eyeo-2014>Takeaways from Eyeo 2014</a></li><li><a href=/blog/hardware-hacker-culture-of-new-york>Hardware Hacker Culture of New York</a></li><li><a href=/blog/future-visions-for-human-interaction>Future Visions for Human Interaction</a></li><li><a href=/blog/openbci-nears-its-kickstarter-goal>OpenBCI Nears it's Kickstarter Goal</a></li></ul><h2 id=2013-ref>2013</h2><ul><li><a href=/blog/sound-chamber-2013>Sound Chamber (2013)</a></li><li><a href=/blog/openbci-hackathon-at-thoughtworks>OpenBCI Hackathon at ThoughtWorks</a></li><li><a href=/blog/exploring-depth-video-at-culturehub>Exploring Depth Video at CultureHub</a></li><li><a href=/blog/introduction-to-ibeacons>Introduction to iBeacons</a></li><li><a href=/blog/volumetric-lab-at-culturehub-nyc>Volumetric Lab at CultureHub NYC</a></li><li><a href=/blog/randomness-in-algorithm>Randomness in the Algorithm</a></li><li><a href=/blog/study-existential>Video: Existential</a></li><li><a href=/blog/the-visual-art-of-brian-eno>The Visual Art of Brian Eno</a></li><li><a href=/blog/rgbdtoolkit-sketch-at-sampler>RGBDToolkit Sketch at The Sampler</a></li><li><a href=/blog/the-artist-geek-hybrid>The Artist-Geek Hybrid</a></li><li><a href=/blog/rgbdtoolkit-calibration-tutorial>RGBDToolkit Calibration Tutorial</a></li><li><a href=/blog/how-depth-sensor-works-in-5-minutes>How a Depth Sensor Works -
