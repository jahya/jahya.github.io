				<p>The programs I initiate and lead deal with diverse themes, enabling practitioner communities to collaborate on key issues in technology, including emerging technologies, climate and sustainability, transhumanism, AI and robotics.</p>
				<p>Starting out as a technical software developer, I went on to practice art production using technology and interactive media. This led to community convening, and then program design and execution, around issues in technology, art, and the role of the tech sector in climate and sustainability.</p>

				<p>I co-founded and led ClimateAction.tech in 2017, a global program whose 10,000+ members drive sustainability initiatives in the tech sector. The program, under active independent leadership today, was awarded a Prix Ars Electronica Award for Digital Humanity in 2021.</p>
				<p>Thoughtworks Arts, an incubator I co-founded for artist-led emerging technology collaborations, activated more than 50 projects with over 400 contributors over seven years, has been credited in Forbes, WIRED, Engadget and the New York Times, and has exhibited at the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum in New York.</p>

				<p>With two decades experience as a hands-on artist, technologist and community catalyst, my approach is to incubate projects building around a shared identity in which we as practitioners and stakeholder see ourselves.</p>
				<p>I believe in the power of guiding teams to find authentic and recognized individual expression through contributions, to see those contributions as key components of a greater project, and in cultivating collective ownership of sustained momentum toward a shared goal.</p>

The visualization is a stylized flat graphic with dynamic splotches of red and black color travelling vertically through a stone-like artery. The screens both also show the same number '87' as an overlay to the visualization." />
