				<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
			</header>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"My work explores what we miss because of how we are constructed &mdash; biologically, socially and psychologically. Using technology to generate and manipulate media, I create situational environments which question the fundamentals of how we navigate, make sense of, and relate to the world."</p>
