				<h1>Statement</h1>
			</header>

			<blockquote>
				<p>"I see my work as interventions which undercut the things we take for-granted just by being human. Our daily experience is composed of a continuous, constructed network of mental signs which govern our perception. Using technology as a medium, I create sensory environments which seek to question - and alter - how we navigate, make sense of, and relate to the world."</p>
