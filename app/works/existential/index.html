					<span class="title">Existential</span> is an exploration into our relationship with our daily surroundings in built-up urban environments. How is it that the waves of human activity around us so often lead to a sense of greater isolation? How do we react to this paradox, consciously and unconsciously, as we navigate public space?

					This piece was created using the experimental cinematic technique of DepthKit - an approach in which recorded depth information is mixed with color and sound. However, for this piece a new color layer was applied in post-processing, to dislocate the swarms of pixels from each other despite their theoretical close proximity.

					There are a <a href="/blog/?tag:RGBDToolkit">series of articles and tutorials</a> in the blog regarding this technique and this video. This piece was made with the support of <a href="http://eyebeam.org">Eyebeam</a>, the <a href="http://nyc.volumetric.org">Volumetric Society</a> and <a href="http://www.culturehub.org/">CultureHub New York</a>.
