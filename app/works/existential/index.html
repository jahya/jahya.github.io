					<span class="title">Existential</span> is an exploration into our relationship with our daily surroundings in built-up urban environments. How is it that the waves of human activity around us so often lead to a sense of greater isolation? How do we react to this paradox, consciously and unconsciously, as we navigate public space?

					This piece was created using the experimental cinematic technique of DepthKit - an approach in which recorded depth information is mixed with color and sound. However, for this piece a new color layer was applied in post-processing, to dislocate the swarms of pixels from each other despite their theoretical close proximity.
