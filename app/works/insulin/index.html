					<span class="title">Insulin</span> explores the human meaning of realtime data as it relates to the body. A wall-mounted computer graphics installation responds in realtime to data from the artist's body.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a type 1 diabetic, the artist manages his blood glucose levels using insulin injections. To help with dosing decisions, he wears a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM).
				</p>
				<img src="/images/works/insulin-diagram.jpg" alt="Glucose values broadcast via the web to the installation" />
				<p>
					The numbers emitted by this sensor are replete with meaning for wearers. They serve as probability indicators for impending hypoglycemia, long-term health implications, or triggers for mental associations such as guilt, fear, or pride in daily lifestyle decisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Under a wall-mounted computer monitor, audiences see a circuit board. This board both reads the realtime data and runs the animation. The installation therefore spans from the daily activities of the artist all the way through to the displayed graphical response, and functions as a response to the meaning those numbers hold.
