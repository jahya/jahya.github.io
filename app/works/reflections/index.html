					<span class="title">Reflections</span> is a site-specific sound work created and installed at the Jaaga structure in Bangalore, India.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the final week before being deconstructed, and in collaboration with Clemence Barret, a series of interviews were conducted with core Jaaga members. The thoughts and perspectives of the community were fed into a custom-designed software and loudspeaker system, and allowed to 'float freely' within the Jaaga walls.
				</p>
				<p>
					This work was created as part of the Jaaga Residency Program.
