					<span class="title">Control Room</span> is a response to the 2004 documentary of the same name by Magnolia Films.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the original film, members of the Al Jazeera media outlet in Qatar debate American military personnel on issues of free speech and media bias in the context of war. The <span class="title">Control Room</span> installation both channels and fragments this conversation using the source media, positioned mirrors, and manipulations of space from which
					observation can take place.
				</p>
				<p>
					The installation questions the nature of memory in relation to real, described, or imagined events, and considers the role of 24-hour news in our construction of a continuous cultural narrative.
