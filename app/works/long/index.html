					<span class="title">Long</span> is an experimental work exploring the process of cognition as a creative process. Rocks, coated with light and sound, are allowed to live and breathe via subtle augmentations.

					<span class="title">Long</span> is the result of a series of experiments into spatial and perceptual resurfacing. The work was created with the support of the I-Park Foundation, Connecticut, and the Contemporary Artist Center (CAC) Woodside, New York.
