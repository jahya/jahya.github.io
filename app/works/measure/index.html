					<span class="title">Measure</span> explores the role of the moment in our continuous perception of time. Each audible strike in a traditional clockwork metronome sets into action a response in a continuously generated audio/visual field.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="title">Measure</span> was created in association with the Young Poets Network and V4W for Alpha-Ville Festival of Post-Digital Culture. It was the winning entry in the Patch Slam competition at Alpha-Ville 2011.
