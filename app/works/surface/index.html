					<span class="title">Surface</span> is an installation which can be recreated in any location with nine assorted pieces of wood - as long as they are between 2' and 8' in height. The pieces are distributed in a darkened space, and a light and sound pattern is generated to 're-surface' them.
				</p>
				<p>
					The installation is a response to the reconfigurability of the Jaaga space in central Bangalore, where <span class="title">Surface</span> was first presented. Jaaga is based on a lightweight building design which can be deconstructed and rebuilt to suit the characteristics of any outdoor location.

				<p>
					<span class="title">Surface</span> considers our relationship to space and materials, and how that relationship changes in differing contexts.
