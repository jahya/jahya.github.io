_Existential_ is an exploration into our relationship with our daily surroundings in built-up urban environments. How is it that the waves of human activity around us so often lead to a sense of greater isolation? How do we react to this paradox, consciously and unconsciously, as we navigate public space?

This piece was created using the experimental cinematic technique of DepthKit - an approach in which recorded depth information is mixed with color and sound. However, for this piece a new color layer was applied in post-processing, to dislocate the swarms of pixels from each other despite their theoretical close proximity.

This piece was made with the support of [Eyebeam](http://eyebeam.org), the [Volumetric Society](http://nyc.volumetric.org) and [CultureHub New York](http://www.culturehub.org/).
