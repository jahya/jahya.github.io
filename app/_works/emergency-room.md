_Emergency Room_ is an immersive media installation examining the global climate crisis through the lens of a personal health crisis.

Video screens buzz and flicker with images of environmental chaos, activism and effects on New Yorkers from extreme weather events such as Superstorm Sandy. The room is flooded deep red, and the persistent noise of a man struggling to breath. The screens are accompanied by a beeping heart-rate monitor.

Climate change has so far proven too broad to grip a majority of people and drive them to action on a scale required to avoid catastrophe. Despite generally acknowledging the massive and devastating consequences of climate change, most people consistently deprioritize it for near-term issues.

Having been diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes in adulthood, I have a personal sense of the feeling of dealing with chronic illness, and of the striving to meet the challenge and achieve good health. It is clear to me that our collective action in response to climate change is grossly inadequate, and we are locking in its worst outcomes.
