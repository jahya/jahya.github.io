_Emergency Room_ is an immersive media installation comparing the way we respond to personal medical conditions with the way have responded to climate change. Twelve screens buzz and flicker with images of activism and environmental chaos, accompanied by a beeping heart-rate monitor.

Despite generally acknowledging the massive and devastating consequences of climate change, we consistently deprioritize it. As such, our collective action in response to the condition is inadequate, and we are locking in its worst outcomes.

_Emergency Room_ features images of activists attempting to build momentum for change, alongside images of observed effects such as rising sea levels and increasing superstorms. Alongside these are images of individuals already dealing with the effects of climate change.
