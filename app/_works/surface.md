_Surface_ is an installation which can be recreated in any location with nine assorted pieces of wood - as long as they are between 2' and 8' in height. The pieces are distributed in a darkened space, and a light and sound pattern is generated to 're-surface' them.

The installation is a response to the reconfigurability of the Jaaga space in central Bangalore, where _Surface_ was first presented. Jaaga is based on a lightweight building design which can be deconstructed and rebuilt to suit the characteristics of any outdoor location.

_Surface_ considers our relationship to space and materials, and how that relationship changes in differing contexts.
