_Control Room_ is a response to the 2004 documentary of the same name by Magnolia Films.

In the original film, members of the Al Jazeera media outlet in Qatar debate American military personnel on issues of free speech and media bias in the context of war. The _Control Room_ installation both channels and fragments this conversation using the source media, positioned mirrors, and manipulations of space from which observation can take place.

The installation questions the nature of memory in relation to real, described, or imagined events, and considers the role of 24-hour news in our construction of a continuous cultural narrative.
