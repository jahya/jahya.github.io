_Gravity_ is a triptych of 8' x 3' canvass panels, phenomenologically transformed by the projection of evolving light and sound. Gravity deals with issues of division, in the context of temporality and impermanence.

This work was created as part of the Jaaga Residency Program. You can also [watch a short feature](/blog/jaaga-journal-features/) on the creation of this piece by the documentarians at Jaaga Journals.
