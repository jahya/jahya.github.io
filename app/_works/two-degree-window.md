What is the current timeline to humankind locking in 2° of global warming? With governments, businesses and people [struggling to achieve](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-climatechange/governments-not-on-track-to-cap-temperatures-at-below-2-degrees-u-n-idUSKCN1LI03S) this target, which determines the [fate of civilization](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/12/03/climate-change-could-lead-collapse-civilization-said-david-attenborough/2195775002/), shouldn’t the timeline be featured prominently in every city?

_The 2° Window_ explores this idea by positing a new type of response to the climate crisis. In this alternative vision, updating data points are installed in major public gathering spots throughout the world, helping to concentrate the minds of individuals on the urgency of climate change, and to drive the demand for change.

This project was created by the [Climate Consciousness](https://artahack.io/projects/climate-consciousness/) team as part of Art-A-Hack 2018.
