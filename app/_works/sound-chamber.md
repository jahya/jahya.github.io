_Sound Chamber_ turns the idea of a 'tech demo' away from the traditional utopian dream sales pitch. Instead, it showcases full-body interaction in the context of failing video and disjointed sound.

The installation is a collaboration with sound technologist [Alex Hornbake](http://alex.hornbake.com/), which grew out of the [Hardware Hack Lab](http://hardwarehacklab.tumblr.com/).

You can find out [more about the lab](http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/creative-culture-hardware-hack) in this article for ThoughtWorks, who supported the creation of this project.
