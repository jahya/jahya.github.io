	<span class="title">Sound Chamber</span> turns the idea of a 'tech demo' away from the traditional utopian dream sales pitch. Instead, it showcases full-body interaction in the context of failing video and disjointed sound.
</p>
<p>	
	The installation is a collaboration with sound technologist <a href="http://alex.hornbake.com/">Alex Hornbake</a>, which grew out of the <a href="http://hardwarehacklab.tumblr.com/">Hardware Hack Lab</a>.
</p>

	You can find out <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/creative-culture-hardware-hack">more about the lab</a> in this article for ThoughtWorks, who supported the creation of this project.
