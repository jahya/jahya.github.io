<p>Yesterday was our first day in the space (<a href="http://www.nutrecht.nl/">Nutrecht</a>). It's a huge empty warehouse building with a number of large empty spaces. When we arrived several other installations were in the process of being set up.</p>

<p>It's very cold, and everyone is walking around with coats and scarves on. Music and random sounds keep kicking out from around the warehouse.</p>

<table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qEwgCA0Pux0/Tt9ulbI1PII/AAAAAAAAARs/vJRlh_1XcgA/s1600/SL372282.JPG" style="clear:left; float:left;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qEwgCA0Pux0/Tt9ulbI1PII/AAAAAAAAARs/vJRlh_1XcgA/s320/SL372282.JPG" width="320" alt="The Meet me in the Middle machine" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">An odd device in the corridor</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>I met the other collaborators first thing at the airport to come out here (most for the first time). <a href="http://www.uberact.com/">Gareth Griffiths</a> is organising and managing the team. <a href="http://www.newoperahero.com/">Mike Wilson</a> is preparing 3D meshes and objects to make up the scene, and <a href="http://vimeo.com/josephmounsey">Joseph Mounsey</a> is working on the visualisation and dynamics of the augmented scene.</p>

<!--excerpt-ends-->

<p><a href="http://almostobsolete.net/">Tom Parslow</a> is writing software to collect data we are interested in from the Kinects, format it and send over the network. <a href="http://cargocollective.com/haydroom">Hayden Anyasi</a> is designing a VVVV patch to handle the 3D scene and feed in the Kinect data, and to push out scene-related data across the network for use in the sound environment.</p>

<table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KubjcCv9aGU/Tt92Psct3PI/AAAAAAAAAR4/KbrZNQyGkjk/s1600/P1010196.JPG" style="margin-right:1em; margin-bottom:1em"><img height="180" width="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KubjcCv9aGU/Tt92Psct3PI/AAAAAAAAAR4/KbrZNQyGkjk/s320/P1010196.JPG" alt="Team V4W working" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Co-working in a cold warehouse</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/manaca">Barney Thorn</a> is working on sound design, writing tracks which can be stretched and morphed by interaction with the Kinects. Alex Hosford and I are working on a Max/MSP environment to listen for Kinect data and use it to stretch, morph and treat Barney's sounds.</p>

<p>So we're all divided into little working groups, huddled around a small desk in a large warehouse. We all had about 1 hour's sleep the previous night, due to an early flight / train out to Utrecht from London.</p>

<table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IqITkwyOyh4/Tt9uc1Emu1I/AAAAAAAAARc/25gS1MO2FBI/s1600/SL372283.JPG"><img alt="Nutrecht chamber" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IqITkwyOyh4/Tt9uc1Emu1I/AAAAAAAAARc/25gS1MO2FBI/s200/SL372283.JPG" width="200" /></a>    <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jD2BkuRk7zM/Tt9uiKEFKBI/AAAAAAAAARk/HkM3bVFiVEQ/s1600/SL372290.JPG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="150" alt="A bicycle" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jD2BkuRk7zM/Tt9uiKEFKBI/AAAAAAAAARk/HkM3bVFiVEQ/s200/SL372290.JPG" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The space already has some installations... and a bicycle</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>We persevered and by the end of the night we had a made a good start. There is a proof-of-concept-style basic interaction running from the first Kinect box through to the sound environment. Barney has written one and a half music tracks! The 3D visuals are started but weren't plugged in yet. A good start.</p>
