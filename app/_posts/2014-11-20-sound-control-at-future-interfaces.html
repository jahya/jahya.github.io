<p>How does it feel to interact naturally with sound? Without touching anything physical?</p>

<p>I decided to experiment with the topic for <a href="http://www.nycmedialab.org/">NYC Media Lab's Future Interfaces</a>, ran at Razorfish NYC last Tuesday. Natural User Interfaces (NUIs) have been getting a shot in the arm recently with Kinect V2, and the immediacy of the interaction is becoming really clear.</p>

<p>Something about this style of interaction for me lends itself to the 'escape from the computer'.</p>

<p>This is the idea that what you are really doing is interacting with the environment, with the sound, vision and space - not a computer. Therefore I focus entirely on the immersive qualities of the experience, such that the 'control' doesn't really feel like control at all.</p> <p>In this installation I focused solely on the hands, and their vertical and horizontal positioning in relation to the sensor. These values are fed to a synthesizer and effects chain, to allow an intuitive interaction with continuously generated sound.</p> <p>People took pretty easily to the experiment - and that's the stage it is at, pure experiment. This builds on the <a href="https://github.com/microcosm/ofxKinectV2-OSC">ofxKinectV2-OSC plugin</a> I created recently, and Adam Carlucci's excellent work with <a href="https://github.com/admsyn/ofxAudioUnit">openFrameworks and audio units</a>.</p>
