<p>The MSI laptop I've been using since 2009 came to an unfortunate end recently - it was in my backpack when I came off my bike. My (slight) injuries healed just fine, the MSI was never quite the same again.</p>

<p>Until now, improvements in Windows, and my use of Win-only software <a href="http://vvvv.org/">vvvv</a> had been enough to stop me migrating to Mac or Linux. I was forced to buy a timely laptop upgrade by the bike accident, but why choose Mac?</p>

<!--excerpt-ends-->

<p><strong>OpenFrameworks and SuperCollider</strong><br />It so happens that I was also trying to <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2012-05-16-getting-started-with-openframeworks-in %}">get started with openFrameworks</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2012-05-28-getting-started-with-supercollider %}">with SuperCollider</a> on another Windows machine. As I discovered, they both <span style="font-style:italic;">work</span> in Windows, they are both <span style="font-style:italic;">supported</span> in Windows, but ultimately they are better supported, better documented and <span style="font-style:italic;">easier to use</span> in Mac.</p>

<p>Obviously that's highly subjective, but it appeared that way to me. And there's a bigger community centered around Mac, which again means better support and more stuff working out-of-the-box. It's a cliche anyway that media artists use Macs - so I decided to join and not fight!</p>

<p><strong>Get it and open it</strong><br />So what's the first thing to do when you get a new Mac? The first thing surely anyone does? Take it apart!</p>

<p>I switched out the stock hard drive for a 256GB solid-state drive (above) and the standard 4GB system memory for 8GB (below).</p>

<figure>
	<img alt="Switching out the memory" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0I9g5Mwu5Vg/T80OscVbETI/AAAAAAAAAso/pIW46xC5U48/s1600/P1019911.JPG">

<p>At 256GB the solid-state hard drive is smaller than the stock one, but since it's solid state it is significantly faster to transfer data between disk and memory.</p>

<p><strong>Get it and break it</strong><br />Then I switched it on. It wasn't happy.</p>

<figure>
	<img alt="New MacBook Pro" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t17sAYxQPGE/T80Pm5LCN0I/AAAAAAAAAtM/SQUBa8BSGYQ/s1600/P1019920.JPG">

<p>But it's just because the new solid-state drive was preformatted with a filesystem that Mac didn't understand (or wasn't formatted at all).</p>

<p>Either way, it was easy to fix. Restart, holding the <code>option</code> key to get to Mac disk utilities. Format the new drive with HFS+ and restart again.</p>

<p>Now the Mac takes over - I just select a Wi-fi connection, and Mac downloads and installs OSX, drivers &amp; updates. The download took 4 hours, but the Mac booted perfectly (and very quickly) from there on in.</p>

<p><strong>Now install Windows 7</strong><br />Yes, the other first thing that I'm sure everyone does when they get a new Mac - install Windows 7 on it.</p>

<p>The reality is I have several works and projects which run in vvvv - software which is based on DirectX, which runs only in Windows. Fortunately, Apple not only make it very easy to install OSX on a new Mac, they also make it very easy to install Windows side-by-side.</p>

<p>All the info I needed was in (or linked from) <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3986">this Mac KB article</a>, and it only took a few hours to:</p> <ol>  <li>Download and burn the Win7 ISO to DVD</li>  <li>Download and burn the Mac / Windows support software (provided by Apple in a single installer, this contains all the hardware drivers and administration utilities required to run a Windows OS on Mac hardware)</p>  <li>Run BootCamp (from OSX) to create a Windows partition and format it with NTFS</li>  <li>Install Windows from the burned DVD</li>  <li>Run the Mac / Windows support software from DVD</li></ol>

<p>That's pretty much all you need to do, and the whole process only took 1-2 hours. The hardest part was finding my Windows 7 product key!</p>

<p>So I'll generally be blogging from the context of Mac software from now on, although I will switch to Windows every now and then for things like vvvv. Very happy so far with the purchase.</p>
