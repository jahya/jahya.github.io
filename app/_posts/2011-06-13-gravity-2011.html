<p>Gravity is an installation work inspired by Mark Rothko and the Seagram Murals. It was installed at Jaaga in June 2011 and was part of the Sound &amp; Lights exhibition in Richmond Town.</p>

<p>What was important for me about Gravity was making a connection with viewers who spend time with the piece. The process of creation was very intuitive, and not pre-planned. In this way I feel the connection is somehow direct, and personal.</p>

<p>There may be a context in which Gravity was conceived and created (at Jaaga in it's final days in Richmond Town), but in contrast to <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2011-06-13-reflections-2011 %}">Reflections</a>, the piece is not strongly associated to that context. It is abstract and psychological in nature. In this vein I think Gravity could be extended, continued, redefined in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Variation and Revelation</strong><br />The aim of the piece is to create a continuous, relentless, slow revelation. With each second that passes, a few new pieces of information, in the form of subtle variations, enter into the audiovisual 'window' of the world. Each new piece of information tells us something about the <span style="font-style: italic">nature</span> of that world, and adds to our understanding of it. In seeking to understand more about that world we become connected to it - the psychology of the viewer becomes increasingly involved.</p>

<p><strong>Composition and Rhythm</strong><br />There are three custom-created canvass panels, onto which light is projected. Each reveals the same tear but with slight and subtle differences in trajectory (pan, tilt and momentum).</p>

<p>The audio and visual movement are continuously generated in real-time, and so there is no 'loop'. The movement of each tear across it's canvass is anchored to the movement of the other two tears. There are three audio synth lines echoing the three tears, and similarly, each is free to choose it's own direction but is anchored to it's peers.</p>

<p>There is also an overarching rhythm which slowly and gently arcs over the piece (it can be heard sometimes as a continuous gentle bass 'thud'). This overarching rhythm is subtle and too broad to follow for long in itself, but it sets the boundaries within which both the visual-triptych and synth-triptych flow; it sets the progressive tone of the whole piece over time.</p>
