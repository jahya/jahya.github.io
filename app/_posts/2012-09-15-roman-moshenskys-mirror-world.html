<p>One of the other residents at I-Park, Roman Moshensky, has created this short film. It's a personal reflection on his stay in Connecticut.</p> <p>The film features several of the residents staying at that time, and the narration is my voice speaking Roman's words.</p>

<p>The film uses the split screen technique Roman has been experimenting with, but where those films focus on the dialog between humans and animals, this film reflects on the relationship between Moshensky, I-Park and the forest.</p> <p>The other residents featured in the film are Jee Soo Shin and Michael Fairfax.</p> <p>In the film, you get to see some of Michael's <a href="http://michaellfairfax.blogspot.com/2012/09/a-post-script-residency-is-over.html">process</a> - which is an awesome sight - as he turns a dead tree into a musical instrument.</p>
