<p>A short video of me speaking at <a href="http://www.culturehub.org/">CultureHub</a>. If you are interested in the <a href="http://www.culturehub.org/volumetric_lab">Volumetric Lab</a> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/volumetric/">RGBDToolkit meetups</a>, this is the kind of work we do:</p>

<p>The Volumetric Lab at CultureHub is an open source, member driven community dedicated to exploring 3D interactive software and hardware. Artists, innovators, and educators engage with interactive motion sensing technologies such as the Kinect and other depth sensing cameras to produce an array of research and experimental art projects.</p>

<p>Participants are strongly encouraged to formulate projects with the open source philosophy in mind. We believe that free distribution and access to project development promotes innovation and empowerment.</p>
