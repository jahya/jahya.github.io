<p>While I was still preparing my <a href="/blog/lightning-fast-overview-art-practice/">lightning talk for Creative Tech Week</a> in May, I got an email from TEDxVilnius asking if I would speak at their event in June.</p>

<p>This gave me just a few weeks to shuffle around my existing commitments, and stretch out a 5 minute talk to a tech crowd into a 15 minute talk for a general audience.</p>

<p>I had to scramble a bit, but I'm glad I did it.</p>

<h2>About the talk</h2>

<p>This talk gave me the opportunity to talk not only about my art practice, but that of those in the community around me. I could explain how the projects we are supporting as part of the <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io">arts residency</a> fit together as a package, and help us look at the future of society.</p>

<p>Subjects I cover in the talk include trans-humanism, climate change, DNA as data and brain surveillance. That's a lot for one talk, but I'm hoping it all comes together to show how art and technology are powerful tools for looking into the future of society.</p>

<h2>About the conference</h2>

<p>The organizers of the TEDxVilnius event were surprisingly excellent. I had no idea that it was run by volunteers &mdash; I thought that considering how organized they were they must all be getting paid.</p>

<p>Once I actually got out to Vilnius and met them all, I realised it was all a labour of love. They did it because they really cared about the speakers, their content and bringing and sharing these ideas with communities in Lithuania.</p>

<p>They really wanted the speakers to have a smooth ride, to intermix and to meet and discuss with local people. They organized several social events, ran coaching sessions and sound-checks, and worked extra hard on building a sense of community.</p>

<p>The result for me was a very special experience. I know from talking with other speakers that many others felt that way too.</p>

<p>Being based in North America I'm not sure when I'll next have the chance to visit Lithuania &mdash; but I hope it's soon.</p>
