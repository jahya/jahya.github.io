<p>Almost on cue from <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2011-10-06-practical-guide-to-generative-art %}">my last post</a>, <a href="http://www.creativeapplications.net/">CAN</a> have <a href="http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/electroplastique-and-grid-distortions-processing/">blogged about Marius Watz</a>. He's a well-known generative artist (and he wrote a foreword for the <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2011-10-06-practical-guide-to-generative-art %}">book I'm reading</a>.)</p>

<!--excerpt-ends-->

<p>In the post, they start off talking about the Grid Distortions series and then go on to post a video (below) in which Marius introduces himself, and a collection of 'random' thoughts.</p><div style="text-align: center"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/30035982?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="534" height="398" frameborder="0"></iframe></div><p>If you're interested in GenArt it's a great watch. In it Marius describes software as a 'material you work with', which is nicely in tune with my current conception of 'software as a medium'.</p><p>Marius goes on to talk about the relationship between his work and music (and the rave scene which influences him, and of which he is 'not ashamed'.)</p><p>He gives a very nice, short, chronological narrative of gen art, or rather the early stages of the contemporary gen art scene. He goes on to talk a little about the precursors and predecessors to this scene.</p><p>He then moves forward and discusses recent exhibitions he's helped curate. He gives some interesting background on the exhibition that accompanied <a href="http://node10.vvvv.org/">Node10</a> in Frankfurt (which I attended and thought was a very nice collection.)</p><p>He explains the way they were trying to include exhibits which had as little to do with technology as possible. This is another sentiment that I respect. Some of the most interesting work at that show was purely algorithmic (carried out by hand) or involved very simple applications of technology.</p>
