<p>This video is of an installation 'sketch' representing the in-progress piece I worked on during the I-Park Residency program.</p>

<p>The shots in this video represent what visitors to I-Park <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-09-14-open-studios-at-i-park %}">Open Studios</a> September saw on the day. It is the same work discussed in my previous post '<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-09-04-perception-as-creative-process %}">Perception as a Creative Process</a>'.</p> <p>The installation is an attempt to create a space which is immediately unfamiliar - purely because of the controlled light and acoustics - but which with time gains a new type of familiarity. The flat blades of colour penetrate the darkness to slowly reveal the objects texture in new ways.</p> <p>At the end of the residency program I was at this fairly initial stage. I will be further developing the work during my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-08-21-residency-at-contemporary-artists-center %}">residency</a> at Contemporary Artist Center, in Troy New York.</p>
