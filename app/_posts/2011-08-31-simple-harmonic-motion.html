<p>Simple Harmonic Motion is an audio-visual project by <a href="http://www.memo.tv/">Memo Akten</a>. He has shared a little about his process and some sketches on <a href="http://www.creativeapplications.net/sound/simple-harmonic-motion-openframeworks-sound/">CAN</a>, so we can see that the underlying pattern to this work is based around sine waveforms.</p>

 <p>It's wonderfully simple - as points along the wave come into contact with a central line segment they trigger sounds and small visual effects. By slowing and speeding the frequency of the wave(s) and by graduated changes other simple variables, we slowly see natural patterns emerge through the audio / visual indicators.</p>
