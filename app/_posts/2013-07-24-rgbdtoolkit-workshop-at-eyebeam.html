<p>Last weekend I attended an <a href="http://www.rgbdtoolkit.com/">RGBDToolkit</a> workshop at <a href="http://www.eyebeam.org/">Eyebeam</a> NYC. I'm posting about it now just because it reminded me how much I enjoy hacking hardware, playing with digital media and exploring new technologies.</p>

<p>The Toolkit is about combining HD video from DSLRs with depth data from <a href="http://www.primesense.com/">PrimeSense</a>-based sensors such as Xtion or Kinect - effectively an early technique for creating 3D cinema. Due to the implementation details there is a particular aesthetic associated with RGBD, but that is true of all media and I'm looking forward to pushing against this aesthetic.</p>

<p>At this stage I just want to note the impact of the workshop. It was great to learn the technique, but more broadly it's re-engaging the artist-geek hybrid within me. And to say thanks to the organizers <a href="http://jamesgeorge.org/">James George</a> and <a href="http://www.alexanderporter.net/">Alexander Porter</a>, who put together a really good, informative, creative workshop experience.</p>

<p>I have some more material on this that I will come back and post in the next few days, as well as the seeds of a potential collaboration.</p>
