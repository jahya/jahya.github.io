<p>I've arrived at my residency at Contemporary Artist Center (CAC) in Troy, New York. In this post I'll show some images of this beautiful location, and talk about the direction I want to take with my work from here.</p> <p>The residency program is now run inside the historic Woodside Church, having moved from it's previous home in North Adams, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The night I arrived I was treated with all the other residents to the regular Sunday meal. The next night I took part in the weekly crit.</p>

<!--excerpt-ends-->

<p>It was refreshing as it's been a while since I've been in a crit and I was able to put together a 'sketch' installation and have my work critiqued too.</p>

<p>I showed a quickly-assembled installation and some media from my time at I-Park, and the conversation got quite in-depth.</p> <p>This provided some context and the views of a set of fresh eyes, and made me think some more about the installation potential the work has, aside from the portable / outdoor aspect.<p> <p>After the crit, I put together the short video below from I-Park, and together the crit and video formed an interesting retrospective. This set a context for the work I'll be developing in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>The initial work developed at I-Park is a good starting point - it shows that the concept works but leaves open the direction.</p> <p>At the moment, there is something open-ended about where the installation sketch takes you once you approach it as a viewer on it's own terms. The journey feels tied to the machine, the coating on the object's surface feels artificial. But what I am looking for is a human connection, one that works with the perceptual process, rather than trying to negate it.  <p>It has a minimalist feeling - which I actually appreciate because of the way it allows the underlying textures to make a statement. But I feel like with some more experimental work there are ways I can express more, playing on the inherent darkness and light, and by finding a more human pace, rhythm, and timbre.</p>

<p>The new studio is a good size and I have had to spend time light-proofing it and setting it up. This is an interesting space to be working and feel this is the best place for the piece to develop right now.</p> <p>I will look at some of the outdoor locations later as the residency progresses and judge whether there is an outdoor component at a later date. But for now, the work is studio-bound.</p>
