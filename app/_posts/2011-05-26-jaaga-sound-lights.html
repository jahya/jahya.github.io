<p>The Sound &amp; Lights exhibition at Richmond Town has been open almost a week now. I took some shots last night to share, and to give a sense of the show for those who can't be here.</p>

<p>From the outside you can see work by Tobias Rosenberger (the two video panels) and Pooja Mallya (the kinetic 'nest' at the top). This is the work that draws in passers-by and local residents who may not have been previously connected to Jaaga - it's clearly visible from the Hockey Stadium and up and down Rhenius Street.</p>

<!--excerpt-ends-->

<p>Eve Sibley's permanent installation, the Vertical Garden is as always on display on the front and side of the building. The plants are watered automatically by a custom-designed hydroponics system periodically throughout the day.</p>

<p>Inside we have work from eight Indian and international artists, and a number of other contributors. The show is open from 6.30PM until 10PM every night until the final night on the 29th of May.</p>

<p>The work is sonic, visual, kinetic, and electronic, very much in keeping with the themes at Jaaga. At the end of the show the building will be torn down! ...and recreated in it's new home at Double Road.</p>

<p>Lisa Kori-Chung has created a reactive sound installation out of discarded electronic components. As you spin the wheels, glitchy but tonal sounds are generated. The piece is pure hardware electronics, with no software intervention.</p>

<p>My work, Gravity, is a three-panel sound and video installation on the ground floor. The work is self-generating: the sound is continually synthesized with new parameters and the video slowly responds to the sound.</p>

<p>Agnese Mosconi has created Murale, a kinetic, responsive installation on the second floor. The flowers respond to your movements by opening and closing, and making noises as you pass by. The piece is modular in the form of a climbing plant, like a parasite.</p>

<p>Corin Faife composed music and designed a system which allows it to respond according to the movements of people in the building. The mood decisions are based on webcam and sensor data, different combinations of movement in different parts of the building are interpreted according to a mood matrix.</p>

<p>In the video installation 'Prime Actant', by Sharath Chandra, the show itself is self-referenced. It contains media related to the artists and their works, and the webcam incorporates visitors into the installation too.</p>

<p>Tobias Rosenberger's work video work is visible on two floors, from both inside and outside the Jaaga building.</p>

<p>On the roof there is also a gentle and reflective multichannel sound installation which is a collaboration between Abhijeet Tambe (Lounge Piranha) and Rosenberger. It features words and music loops, and is a popular space to relax and enjoy the evening.</p>

</figure>

<p>The 'nest', which hovers above the roof of Jaaga used to be a space for quiet solitary contemplation, served only by a single chair and a view of Shantinagar... until Pooja Mallya turned it into a kinetic light installation! It is now furnished with a carved metal logo, lights, fabric wings and a moving frame.</p>

</figure>

<p>The people at Power-Up Electronics have created a number of programmable LED boards, and installed them across the building. Together they slowly drift to different colours and change the mood and visible texture of the Jaaga space.</p>

<p>If you haven't already had a chance to see the show, please head down between now and the final day on Sunday!</p>
