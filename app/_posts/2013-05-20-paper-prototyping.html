<p>What is the quickest way to try out a complicated tech idea on real people? How do you get real, valuable feedback from users without going to the expense of writing code?</p>

<p>Paper prototyping is an idea I've recently been introduced to at ThoughtWorks. You draft up the interface on pieces of paper, and have a human act as the computer would, swapping out bits of paper in response to a real user.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages and limitations</strong><br />Ben O'Hear explains the concept in the above video. As he describes, the advantages are:</p>

<ul><li>It costs far less than developing even basic software</li><li>You can get very early feedback, even before writing any code - and that feedback could have significant impact on what code you write (or don't write)</li><li>If a user does something unexpected, you can respond ad-hoc and get feedback on your improvised response</li><li>You can work collaboratively and iterate rapidly - i.e. a group of you can discuss the user's interactions and sketch out a whole new UI there and then, and test it out again on users</li></ul>

<p>Some of the disadvantages are:</p>

<ul><li>It's easy to test out big ideas, but hard to zero in on small details</li><li>You are constrained by location - you can't test remote responses to user actions. However, on this point, it seems to me that you could simulate some types of remote testing using Skype</li><li>You are constrained by paper - you can't have detailed real-time responsiveness, e.g. Kinect interactions, or sound synthesis. However, again you could simulate this using human voice or recorded sound</li><li>As in all usability testing, this can tell you whether users understand your app, and can use it - it doesn't tell you whether users <span style="font-style: italic;">want</span> to use your app or are willing to <span style="font-style: italic;">pay</span> for it</li></ul>

<p>This is a very <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Startup">lean startup</a> way of thinking, in which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validated_learning">learning about your users</a> is the preferred unit of measure - rather than completing features.</p>
