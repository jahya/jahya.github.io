title: What I Was Doing While I Wasn't Blogging
author: Andrew McWilliams

<p>It is mildly ironic that the times when you are most active, and have the most to say, are also when you have the least time to blog.</p>

<p>That's what I've found anyway &mdash; over the last 18 months I have done an absolute ton, and not blogged at all. It's time to change that.</p>

<!--excerpt-ends-->

<p>Just turning the pages quickly in my mind: I have launched a new, funded <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/">arts &amp; technology residency program</a> here in New York, and worked with <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/bio/cyborg-foundation/">three</a> <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/bio/heather-dewey-hagborg/">brilliant</a> <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/bio/hannes-bend/">artists</a> to help achieve their <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/projects/">project ambitions</a>.</p>

<p>In the residency we have looked at issues of trans-humanism &amp; cyborgism, genetic surveillance, biometrics in VR, and Artificial Intelligence. All of this I have done with my brilliant collaborator <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/bio/ellen-pearlman/">Ellen Pearlman</a>, and with the support of my incredible host company, <a href="https://thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>.</p>

<p>Together we ran a full <a href="https://artahack.io/">Art-A-Hack co-creation program</a> with <a href="https://artahack.io/alumni/">50 multi-disciplinary participants</a> to create <a href="https://artahack.io/projects/">nine experimental projects</a> in emerging tech, looking at Brain-Computer Interface, Virtual &amp; Mixed Reality, Natural User Interfaces, and assistive technology.</p>

<p>We announced our first <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/open-call/2017-implications-of-ai/">AI Open Call</a>, with the help &amp; support of <a href="https://artificialintelligencenow.com/schedule/conference/speaker/meredith-whittaker">Meredith Whittaker</a> of <a href="https://artificialintelligencenow.com/">AI Now</a>. We reviewed 63 exceptional applications, and <a href="https://thoughtworksarts.io/blog/karen-palmer-ai-residency/">awarded a residency</a> to Karen Palmer to develop her interactive AI film, <a href="http://karenpalmer.uk/portfolio/riot/">RIOT</a>. We look forward to welcoming Karen in the Fall of 2017.</p>

<p>In my personal practice, I have created a major new installation work, named <a href="/works/emergency-room/">Emergency Room</a>, which was presented at a <a href="http://www.harvestworks.org/calls-to-action/">solo exhibition at HarvestWorks New York</a>, in 2016. The work looks at the relationship between personal health, biometrics and global warming.</p>

<p>I have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKTkPuMF7ho">presented my work</a> at Creative Tech Week in New York, and at <a href="http://www.tedxvilnius.com/2017/speakers/andrew-mcwilliams">TEDxVilnius</a>, in Lithuania (video coming soon). This has given me the fantastic opportunity to learn how to communicate and share this work with a general audience.</p>

<p>I have worked with employees from Google, Facebook, Tumblr, Soundcloud and many more to form <a href="https://climateaction.tech">ClimateAction.Tech</a>, which looks at the role technologists can play in the urgent issue of climate change.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/tech-workers-join-the-resistance-in-the-name-of-climate-justice-d5c5d96f830b">group</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/gg-oUlz8Ahc?t=1m12s">we</a> <a href="https://technical.ly/brooklyn/2017/04/13/brooklynites-quietly-fomenting-tech-sector-protest-trump-administration/">attended</a> the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/29/us/politics/peoples-climate-march-trump.html">People's Climate March in DC</a>, and have now started working on ways to bring tech companies and businesses further into sustainability and climate activism.</p>

<p>Finally, the most meaningful and exciting occasion I can think of. Last summer I proposed to my loving partner of over nine years, Julie Yaunches, and to my delight she accepted!</p>

<p>We will be married at Mount Tremper Arts, in the Hudson Valley of upstate New York, on August 5th this year, surrounded by friends &amp; family in the open New England air. Out of everything I have done, of this I am proudest, and to have found such a wonderful and loving partner makes me happiest of all.</p>

<p>That's a lot to have done, in the 18 months since I <a href="/blog/crash-course-responsible-dataviz/">last blogged</a>, and that's just the most major and public stuff. There are a lot of projects, events and activities not mentioned here. That's the pace of life I have discovered here in New York &mdash; people all over this city are living at this type of pace.</p>

<p>However, it's good to stop, blog and reflect on life as it goes by. Going forward there is a lot more in all these various pipelines. I'm planning to keep up the trajectories of all of the above, but also to make a point of dropping notes into my blog more frequently as things move along.</p>
