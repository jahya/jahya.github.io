<p>I've accepted a one-month residency at <a href="http://www.cactroy.org/">Contemporary Artists Center</a> (CAC), at the converted Woodside Church in Troy, New York.</p>

<p>I'm planning to use the time to develop some of my large-format projection installation work, such as the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2011-06-13-gravity-2011 %}">Gravity installation</a> I developed at Jaaga. I'll be looking for new dimensions in which to expand the work, both physically and contextually.</p> <p><strong>About CAC</strong><br />CAC is a non-profit art organisation founded in 1990 in Massachusetts. In 2007 they acquired the Woodside Church and Chapel, and now offer residencies, exhibitions and performances. The organisation is just beginning a <a href="http://www.troyrecord.com/articles/2012/08/20/news/doc5031babd0a512564086050.txt">renovation process</a> that will lead to a new gallery and performance space in the church.</p>

<p>The studios on offer with the residency are also inside the church itself. Lighting is (at least partly) provided by stained glass windows. The dramatic shots above are all from <a href="http://www.cactroy.org/photos.php">the CAC website</a>.</p> <p>I'm looking forward to traveling up there next month and checking out the space!</p>
