<p>It's actually quite an odd task we have set ourselves here. Rather than build an installation between three collaborators over eight days, we will be working as 8 collaborators over 3 days. It's a very quick project, but with a lot of people and large scope for the size.</p><p>The theme of this year's <a href="http://freemote.nl/">Freemote festival</a> is 'Threshold'. Based on an online conversation and a single meeting, the group have come up with an outline for the installation we are going to attempt.</p> <p>Gareth has sent out some design images which summarise our aims:</p> <table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cADzckqZUb8/Tt6Q-M2TaHI/AAAAAAAAAPk/E6KCa6ojY90/s1600/Designs+Img1.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="197" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cADzckqZUb8/Tt6Q-M2TaHI/AAAAAAAAAPk/E6KCa6ojY90/s320/Designs+Img1.png" alt="The hardware setup consists of an active area covered by Kinects attached to a server and a projector" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">1.

But this gives us a good solid framework with which to start. Given the size of the group and the time we have available, it's good that we have a clear starting point.</p>
