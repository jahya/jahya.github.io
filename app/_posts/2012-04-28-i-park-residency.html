<p>I have just accepted a residency at <a href="http://www.i-park.org/">I-Park</a>, Connecticut starting in mid-August 2012!</p> <table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.i-park.org/index.html" style="clear:right; float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img height="210" width="283" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3Dv80fPuUvw/T5x6-8st3zI/AAAAAAAAAlA/qlMrMaOj5zo/s1600/NNProjectOverview.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The I-Park house</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>I-Park is a unique space - it is a woodland retreat, and the work I do will be embedded in the natural environment. This is a first for me, having always exhibited in cities (although <a href="http://jahya.net/blog/?tag:Jaaga_Residency">not always in a whitewall gallery</a>!)</p> <p>From the I-Park website:</p> <blockquote>"I-Park is a 450-acre woodland retreat in rural East Haddam, Connecticut. The property consists of ponds, hills, streams, stone outcroppings and sheer cliffs. It has wild fields and new growth forest, as well as miles of stonewalls and walking trails. It is bisected by the Eight Mile River and adjoins the Devil's Hopyard State Park and other preserved tracts. The land has a wild, gnarly character that suits I-Park's role as a refuge from and recourse to the safe routines and subtle compromises of the workaday world."</blockquote> <p>I will be experimenting with the intersection between portable projection and land art, inspired by the work of <a href="http://prickimage.com/">Shaun / PRICKIMAGE</a>, and my friend <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brainflakes/3036022224/">Andrew Crowe</a>. I will keep this blog updated with my preperations and progress. So watch this space!</p> <p>My friend and fellow resident at Jaaga, <a href="http://deweyhagborg.com/">Heather Dewey-Hagborg</a> created a piece for I-Park in 2010, entitled <a href="http://deweyhagborg.wordpress.com/2010/09/08/buried-sound-series-1-bower/">Bower</a>. And there is a <a href="http://www.i-park.org/FellowsbyYear.html">long list of previous fellows</a> who have created work at I-Park since 2001.</p>   <p>This will be a great chance to get out of city life and produce something unique and different!</p>
