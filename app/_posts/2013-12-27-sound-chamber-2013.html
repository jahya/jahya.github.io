<p>In what ways can a human body control continuously-generated synthetic sound?</p> <p>That's the question that drove <a href="http://alex.hornbake.com/">Alex Hornbake</a> and I to create Sound Chamber, an exploratory audio-visual installation presented at <a href="http://info.thoughtworks.com/new-york/">ThoughtWorks New York</a> in 2013.</p> <div style="text-align: center"><iframe style="border:0;" height="280" width="500" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/78NCrNWdUdM" title="YouTube video player"></iframe></div> <p>This project was one of the outcomes of <a href="http://hardwarehacklab.tumblr.com/">Hardware Hack Lab</a>, a co-working space for technologists and artists run every Wednesday here in New York.</p> <p>In it we took a close look at full-body interaction using commercial depth devices such as the Kinect or Asus Xtion. We tied these devices up to a custom-designed sound synthesis environment built with SuperCollider, and out also to video screens placed around the space.</p> <p>Alex &amp; I considered this project a creative exploration, and the installation an unfinished demo - an outcome of the exploration. As such, all the code is <a href="https://github.com/alexhornbake/soundChamber">up on Github</a> along with instructions to replicate. We feel pretty good about adding this mode of interaction to our toolbox and plan to experiment more in the new year.</p>
