<p>In this video Brian Eno talks about the motivations behind his visual art practice. There are some great quotes in here, and sentiments I think many of us share, like not being able to sit down and fully appreciate the time-stretched presence of your creation until an audience is in front of it and you can no longer change it.</p>

<p>A few of the scenes in the video are shot with RGBDToolkit, which is how I came across it, but actually that's a very small fraction of the video. The makers of this film have used a technique I was thinking of experimenting with later - overlaying the 'wrong' video over a depthmap. A bit like projection mapping in virtual space.</p>
