<p>This is the I-Park graveyard...<br />The graveyard of previous artist's installation work which has died on the grounds:</p>

<p>I-Park has been around for over ten years, and with 6-7 artists in each season, they accumulate a lot of art on the grounds. Some of it doesn't survive, is temporary in nature, or was related to a performance piece. When this work is dismantled, this is where it ends up.</p>

<p>There are mixed arrangements of objects, mostly rusted or dirty, many are new homes for insects.</p>

<p>Artists from previous residencies have taken the time to organise and lay out this area into a kind of window-shopping experience. This area is tucked away behind the Red Barn, hidden from some of the more picturesque locations. But this junkyard of objects is more my natural home.</p>

<p>Ralph Crispino took us to the graveyard as the last stop on our introductory tour. I'm sure you'll see some of these objects again.</p>
