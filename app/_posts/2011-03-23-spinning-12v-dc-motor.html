<p>Yesterday, we tested a fairly timid 5V DC Motor with Arduino, and I <a href="{{ site.url }}{% post_url 2011-03-22-spinning-dc-motor %}">blogged about the experience of setting it up and figuring out the components</a>.</p><p>Today we used exactly the same circuit, but switched to a more powerful 12V DC Motor which we picked up in SP Road for 175INR (Â£2.50). The only change we made was to switch up the variable power supply to 12V.</p>

<p>In short, compared to the 5V motor, the 12V is much more powerful, faster, and much noisier! At the store thy offered a range of speeds but we picked the fastest, as you can always slow the speed programmatically using PWM (as shown in the video).</p><div style="text-align: center"><iframe allowfullscreen="1" frameborder="0" height="328" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/AWEX1T3Mxew" title="YouTube video player" width="538"></iframe></div><p>Due to the noise I can't imagine using this motor in an otherwise silent environment (unless the concept is to play up the tech/inner workings) - it's just <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> noisy, and not a traditionally-speaking 'pleasant' noise at all. It would be useful to know if there are ways you can reduce or dampen the noise emitted.</p>
